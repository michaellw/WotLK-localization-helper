315,Staff of Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan,The pieces of this staff still crackle with energy. Yet it also appears to have suffered extensive fire damage.
317,Tyrande's Favorite Doll,"This is a simple night elven doll. The hands and feet are of porcelain, painted with flaking purple. The garments are fine but fraying. The doll's long tresses are the most remarkable and could possibly be real night elf hair."
319,Bones of Transformation,"These bones show a curious mixture of humanoid arms and serpentine tail, convincing you that they are probably from a naga. What is more interesting is that the skeleton has been articulated and posed as if it was once displayed in a museum."
323,Carcanet of the Hundred Magi,"The kaldorei are one of the most ancient races of Azeroth.

The sphere seems to move about within the emerald, not trapped exactly as much as flitting about like an insect."
331,Castle of Sand,"The tol'vir were originally stone constructs created by the titans to safeguard the secrets of Uldum.  They possess feline lower bodies and heads as well as human torsos.

349,Mummified Monkey Paw,"This appears as nothing more than the paw of a small primate. A closer inspection shows that the hand has been dried by centuries of exposure to the sands of Uldum. Still, you have no doubt that it is far more than meets the eye."
351,Staff of Ammunae,"This is a long staff with a gold head piece. In the center of the head is a green gem of some unknown mineral that allows light to shine through. The staff is warm to the touch and if left too long in one place, plants turn to face it as if facing the sun."

2071,Elemental Bellows,"The Blackrock Clan originally used the naturally occurring elemental-fueled infernos of ancient Draenor to shape and harden their namesake ore.

2087,Ancestral Talisman,Consultation with the spirits of previous generations is considered essential to Shadowmoon shamans whenever an important decision is to be made.

2089,Flask of Blazegrease,"Sticky, smelly, and highly flammable, the substance in this small container is liberally applied to the swords and axes of the Burning Blade clan before battle.

2091,Gronn-Tooth Necklace,The Thunderlords are the greatest big game hunters in all of Draenor. For centuries they have used riding beasts and coordinated assaults to slay game and gronn alike. Their clan draws their name from an ancient chieftain who single-handedly slew a powerful gronn at the pinnacle of Thunder Peak.
2093,Doomsday Prophecy,"This tablet speaks of the ""end times."" From what you can decipher, the crude scrawls of multiple authors speak of at least seven different and sometimes conflicting versions of a final reckoning for all of the inhabitants of Draenor. Eerily, the iconography of a flaming hammer is clearly depicted - is this the ancestral origin of the Twilight's Hammer clan?"
2095,Stonemaul Succession Stone,"Chieftains rule small bands of ogres with an iron fist, and are never short on challengers. The Stonemaul clan have notoriously high turnover rate in their leadership; judging from the layers of bloodstains this stone appears to have been instrumental in deposing multiple Stonemaul chieftans."
2097,Stone Manacles,"Rather than using clasps and locks, Ogres bind their slaves using unbroken stone circlets. Their centuries of manipulating earth elements lets them simply shrink the manacles tightly around the slave's ankles, wrists, or neck."
2099,Ogre Figurine,"Expressing with sculpture what most ogres could struggle to explain in words, this statue summarizes the most important ogre physical attribute: size. The clefthoof held above the ogre's head displays strength, while the robust waistline symbolizes great wealth."
2101,Pictogram Carving,"While the written word is mostly used as an instrument for the upper echelons of imperial ogre society, occasionally an ordinary ogre will try his hand at making a story immortal. This pictogram appears to tell the story of an especially distressing culinary experience."
2103,Gladiator's Shield,"Disagreements between ogres usually end in violence. During the early decades of the Age of Order, a sly chieftain decreed that disputes in his clan would be settled via proxy in one-on-one combat between slaves. The mortality rate amongst the ogres plummeted, leading to a golden age of expansion."
2107,Mortar and Pestle,"Preferring to show off their physique, ogres eschew garments that cover too much skin. In order to look more fearsome to their enemies, they adorn their bodies with warpaints created in these grinding tools. This mortar and pestle set is stained yellow, indicating it was used by the Boulderfist clan."
2109,Eye of Har'gunn the Blind,"While most ogres are born with two eyes, a handful in every generation regress and are born with a single eye. All but a few clans recognize these ogres are exceptional and destined for great things. An unlucky one-eyed ogre mage lost his eye in a duel and replaced it with this fist-sized stone, discovering it to have magical properties when he did so."
2111,Stone Dentures,"Ogres are straightforward in combat and often suffer as much punishment as they dish out, relying on their strength and stamina to carry them to victory. These serrated-tooth dentures are proof that at least one ogre had all of his teeth knocked out and lived to fight another day."
2113,Rylak Riding Harness,"A brilliant ogre once had a thought that riding a rylak would make travel much faster than using pack animals or walking. Roughly crafted from thick leather and utilizing an excessive number of knots, this seat could comfortably accommodate an ogre. However, it could only be saddled on a rylak the size of a small mountain which seems to explain why no one has ever seen ogres fly."
2115,Imperial Decree Stele,"Assembled fragments from this stone stele place it in Talador several hundred years before the draenei arrived. It marks an ogre imperial decree to raze several orc settlements in retaliation for a number of rebellious raids against Gorian slave trade caravans. The orders were likely carried out, since the towns no longer exist, and this stone was erected to memorialize the dark deed."
2117,Sorcerer-King Toe Ring,Imperial ogres jealously guard the secrets of magic in order to keep their status among the ruling class. The wealthiest among them adorn themselves with magically-enhanced jewelry and other wearable artifacts.
2119,Warmaul of the Warmaul Chieftain,"The first great technological innovation in ogre society was the concept of attaching a rock to the end of a very long stick to smash your enemies, rather than attempting to bash them with a rock held in your hand. The schism this innovation created amongst ogre society resolved itself only when the now-forgotten tribe broke in to the Warmaul and Boulderfist clans."
2121,Dreamcatcher,"When Terokk returned from exile he was broken and flightless. Rumors of his cursed state swept like wildfire through the Arakkoa, giving rise to superstitious charms and cures. Dreamcatchers endure as one of the most clung-to icons of safety, for the Arakkoa believe the curse will entangle itself in the dreamcatcher and fade in the morning sunlight."
2126,Burial Urn,"In death all Arakkoa seek to join the Sun-God Rukhmar in the skies above Draenor, thus cremation is vastly preferred to burial. Some have their ashes scattered high in the skies, others are collected in ornate urns and placed in crypts."
2128,Decree Scrolls,"The incomplete writings here seem to indicate a decree of a sort of martial law, and reminders to be vigilant for signs of the curse amongst neighbors and friends."
2130,Solar Orb,"Central to High Arakkoan culture is reverence of Rukhmar and the sun. Hundreds of Solar Orbs are scattered around Skyreach, which cast a never-ending light so no Arakkoan need go without the sun's warmth, even on a cold and overcast day."
2132,Sundial,"This delicately-engraved instrument, when positioned correctly, acts as both a sundial and an arakkoa seasonal calendar. The base of the instrument is covered with callouts for celestial events, most of which are accompanied by grave warnings. Interestingly, the device seems to have cryptically predicted the arrival of the draenei a century before it happened."
2134,Talonpriest Mask,"Believing they have been abandoned by the sun, cursed Arakkoa prefer to hide in the forests or beneath awnings during daylight hours. Talonpriests take this a step further and never show their faces to the sun, wearing ritual masks that act as a focus for their communes with Anzu."
2136,Outcast Dreamcatcher,"Outcast Arakkoa have repurposed the dreamcatcher not to ward off the Curse of Sethe, but to capture and harvest tiny amounts of essences from their lost gods. Rumors persist of an ever-growing mass of swirling energy buried deep beneath Skettis, whispering promises of power to any who will listen..."
2138,Apexis Crystal,"Scattered in the most ancient of ruins on Draenor are fragments and whispers of the Apexis civilization, who attained a height of power during the Age of Order and then abruptly vanished. The arrival of the Iron Horde has prompted a secret but urgent escalation in retrieving Apexis artifacts by the Adherents."
2140,Apexis Hieroglyph,"Brittle and ancient beyond measure, this stone tablet contains carvings that vaguely describe an engine of incredible power, claiming to harness the power of the sun."
2142,Apexis Scroll,"This battered scroll case has corroded shut, and the scroll within is barely readable with very careful examination. These appear to be plans and measurements for a glorious ""Temple in the Sky,"" written in an ancient hand. It's unclear whether such a splendid structure was ever built."
2144,Beakbreaker of Terokk,"Eschewing traditional Arakkoan weaponry, Terokk carried this cudgel as a symbol of his fall from king to outcast heretic. Rumors have persisted for centuries that rather than employing traditional wing-cutting as a punishment, Terokk simply shattered the beaks of those who dared to oppose him."
2337,Ancient Nest Guardian,"Harnessing the power of the sun as a never-ending power source, these constructs were originally built as caretakers for young Arakkoa. With the escalating conflict between the Adherents of Ruhkmar and the Outcasts, many have been repurposed as instruments of war."
2339,Ancient Frostwolf Fang,"In life, no two creatures will share a stronger relationship than that of a Frostwolf orc and his or her companion wolf. The two eat, sleep, and fight side by side until one or both dies an honorable death. Even then, sometimes not even death itself can stop a frostwolf from coming to the aid of its beloved orc."
2350,Calcified Eye in a Jar,"This well-preserved eye must have once belonged to a chieftain of the Bleeding Hollow clan. Upon ascension to ruler of the clan, each chieftain undertakes a shamanic vision quest in which they sacrifice their own eye to receive a vision of their own death. You can only imagine the grisly fate this clouded eye bore witness to."
2435,Violetglass Vessel,"The Highborne's penchant for all things purple predates the War of the Ancients. Glass bowls were fairly common, and used to hold anything from grain to gold ingots."
2437,Inert Leystone Charm,"Many Highborne superstitiously carried bits of leystone as a lucky charm. Such charms were typically worn by rural farmers, struggling academy students, or those sitting on the cusp between commonfolk and nobility."
2439,Quietwine Vial,"""Quietwine"" was an ancient Highborne term that simply meant ""poison"". Ironically, after ten thousand years in the ground, the substance typically loses its lethality and becomes a mild intoxicant."
2441,Pre-War Highborne Tapestry,"Tapestries woven before the time of Queen Azshara's pact with the demons typically display a unique ""under-over-over"" style of needlework that has not been seen since."
2443,Nobleman's Letter Opener,"As is always the case with letter openers, this is a completely useless tool, kept only as an excuse to have a murder weapon nearby in situations where it would be socially unwise to carry a dagger."
2445,Trailhead Drum,"Not all Highmountain tauren were hunters, but those that were typically commemorated their first kill with a ceremonial drum, stretched with the hide of their quarry. Most trailhead drums are made with rabbithide or foxhide. Hunters typically carried them for the rest of their lives."
2447,Moosebone Fish-Hook,"Moosebone was, at the time, the most common material for fishhooks: solid enough carve a barb into, but pliable enough not to break off in the mouth of a large salmon. Many fishermen carved elaborate designs into their ""lucky hooks""."
2449,Hand-Smoothed Pyrestone,"It was customary for a widow, child, or grandchild to keep a pyrestone from the funeral pyre of an especially loved one. These stones were carried in a pocket and rubbed for courage, comfort, or in rememberance of a lost companionship."
2451,Drogbar Gem-Roller,"While most drogbar appreciated the rough edges of a raw gemstone, others preferred a smoother, rounder jewel. Rather than using standard gemcutting tools, they used a hand-cranked stone device, which tumbled the gems over the course of several weeks. These were typically operated by servants, slaves, or disobedient youngsters."
2453,Stonewood Bow,"The limbs of the bow are carved from a rock-hard tree wood, which make it nearly impossible to draw. Archaeologists disagree as to whether the bow was originally so hard, or whether the wood simply petrified with age. Either way, the size and heft of the bow suggest that it was only used by the most practiced of tauren hunters."
2455,Imp's Cup,"Imps have to drink too, and many prefer to bring their own cup with them. Some theorize that an ancient imp-like race revered their drinking vessels as something sacred, and a part of that ritual remained even after they were indoctrinated into the Burning Legion."
2457,Flayed-Skin Chronicle,"Different breeds of demon exhibit different behaviors between battles. Succubi, for example, have a tendency to keep detailed logs of their day-to-day activities. Their accounts are often lurid, almost always grotesque, and were typically written onto ""paper"" made from the skin of an enemy or a captive."
2459,Malformed Abyssal,"The ritual to summon an abyssal is complicated, and often fails. When a failure occurs, a small piece of the demon typically remains behind, seething with a combination of latent demonic rage and despair at its own dysfunction. Ancient battlegrounds are littered with such stones."
2461,Orb of Inner Chaos,"Chaos does not come easily to all demons - some struggle with the ways of the Burning Legion. Those that did often carried an enchanted orb that invoked the rage required of any good demon. It is not known how the orbs were made, or who made them."
2463,Houndstooth Hauberk,"A massive piece of ""mail"" chest armor, crafted entirely out of demonic hounds' teeth. The points of the teeth face upward and inward, making the armor impossible to remove once worn - that is, impossible to remove without tearing the flesh of the wearer."
2466,Starlight Beacon,"This handheld device was used by star-augurs to focus immense amounts of starlight into a small, concentrated area.  The device was mainly used during festivals, star-worship rituals, or when the augur needed to reach something on a high shelf."
2469,Crown Jewels of Suramar,"The ruling princes and princesses in Suramar chose only to wear their crowns at the most formal events.  They were kept locked up at all other times, and were considered unstylish."
2471,Key of Kalyndras,"Black Rook Hold was maintained and upkept by a small army of servants.  One such servant was named Kalyndras, who was responsible for overseeing the Hold's armory and munitions storage.  Like most of Ravencrest's servants, he fell to demons during the War of the Ancients."
2473,Orb of Sciallax,This immensely powerful Highborne spell focus was shattered in a reckless archaeological expedition. Its shards are all that remain.
2475,Key to Nar'thalas Academy,"This key does not open any door.  Rather, it is a ceremonial gesture of invitation to the Academy, as a way of saying, ""Our doors are open to you."""
2477,Spear of Rethu,"Revered by miners and blacksmiths, Rethu Ironhorn was one of the first tauren settlers in the Broken Isles.  His descendants carry on his tradition of metalworking at Ironhorn Enclave, near the peak of Highmountain."
2479,Prizerock Neckband,"The drogbar have always been masters at jewelcrafting.  In particular, tribal shaman would wear heavy, three-stoned necklaces.  These necklaces were passed down from master to student."
2481,Spirit of Eche'ro,"Eche'ro was the pet, mount, and battle companion of Huln Highmountain, legendary hero of the War of the Ancients."
2483,Crystalline Eye of Undravius,"The eye of a powerful demon, preserved in the cold, stony ground of Stormheim. Writings from the time of the War of the Ancients state that Undravius was a fel lord commander with designs on removing all life from Azeroth."
2485,Imp Generator,"Under the guidance of uncooperative mo'arg engineers, demon hunters were able to create several of these portals to Mardum.  Unfortunately, they never quite caught on, as they usually let more demons out than in."
2487,Infernal Device,Many a reckless adventurer has met her end by activating one of these devices without knowing its function.  It is often unclear as to whether its activation will summon a single imp or a legion of pit lords.
2489,Blood of Young Mannoroth,It is unclear why any being - demonic or Azerothian - would choose to put themselves on Mannoroth's bad side by keeping some of his blood in a jar.
2491,Purple Hills of Eredath,"In their haste, the draenei brought few artifacts with them as they left Argus.  This book is one of the few relics that has survived the trip to this day."
2513,Ceremonial Bonesaw,"The Drust would often use various animals in their rituals, mostly for their organs. Bonesaws were pivotal in breaking through some of the larger animals' rib cages in order to extract the heart of the beast."
2514,Ancient Runebound Tome,"Tomes were often kept by the strongest of the Drust, preserving the incantations of their magics and serving as conduits for harnessing their power. Scholars have tried to translate the ancient language transcribed within these tomes, only to find themselves going mad as they furthered their understanding of what had been written."
2515,Disembowling Sickle,"Many tools have been discovered that the Drust used in their rituals. One such tool was a sickle, used for ripping through the bellies of their sacrifices, spilling their entrails and allowing the Drust to use their organs in dark rituals."
2516,Jagged Blade of the Drust,"Used for both combat and ancient ceremonies, the blades of the Drust are fearsome objects. When wielded by a Drust, this blade can quickly find it's way into any vital organ within a matter of seconds."
2517,Ritual Fetish,"When the Drust were first learning to attach souls into constructs, they used the bones of their dead as hosts. Once the ritual was complete, these fetishes were said to emanate an eerie blue light, presumably the essence of the soul's power made manifest."
2518,Akun'Jar Vase,"The Zandalari praise many powerful spirit gods known as the Loa. One of which is the great thunder lizard, Akunda, the loa of storms and new beginnings. He believes that the storm has the power to wash away regret and sorrow."
2519,Urn of Passage,"During the final era of the Council of Tribes, a blood plague broke out, killing thousands of trolls. It was deemed that the bodies, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be burned and kept in special urns. As time progressed, this method became commonplace among the Zandalari in disposing of their dead."
2520,Rezan Idol,"Throughout the ages, many kings have ruled over the Zandalari empire. Each one however, knew their place when it came to the great loa and offered their praise to the mightiest of all of them, Rezan. This loa honors deeds over words, but takes slights very seriously and had been known to harbor grudges."
2521,High Apothecary's Hood,"Practioners of alchemy among the Zandalari kept a tight society within the empire known as the ""Shadra'Zan"". Entrance into the guild included a ritual which would require the inductee to imbibe a potion made from their own blood. Should they withstand the effects, they were deemed worthy to learn the secrets kept within."
2522,Bwonsamdi Voodoo Mask,"To honor the loa of death, Zandalari would don these masks in their rituals and pray to him. Bwonsamdi in turn would either answer in kind, or curse them with pain, depending on his mood. Bwonsamdi himself is the protector of the dead and brings the spirits of any who worship him into his realm, ""Da Other Side""."
2523,Soul Coffer,"When a soul is called from the afterlife, it is free to roam the material realm if it is not restrained within moments of its arrival. The Drust created prisons for these souls for later use in their dark rituals, during which time the soul would suffer within Thros, and become a twisted version of what it once had been."
2524,Blowgun of the Sethra,"The trolls of the desert who worshipped Sethraliss used these blowguns to hunt their prey, be it beast or troll. The poison the darts were dipped in would paralyze their prey, and within a minute, kill them. ""The Sting of Sethraliss"" was whispered to children in order to keep them in line, as was written in an ancient poem: ""Should the young turn defiant, show anger or malice, the winds of Vol'dun will bring the Sting of Sethraliss."""
2525,Croak Crock,"During times of war, the Zandalari faced off against many powerful foes. Some, even, that they could not break. Their witchdoctors devised these cursed pots and through the use of powerful magic, summoned them at different locations within the enemy's encampment. Shortly after, a fountain of frogs would spring forth, causing a ruckus and confusing the enemy in the process. Little did they know that these frogs carried a plague with them that would quickly devastate their ranks and force them to retreat or surrender."
2526,Intact Direhorn Hatchling,"The Zandalari are regarded for their beast taming, and one of their greatest allies is that of the direhorn. Plated skin, with spikes protruding from various directions, this creature offered both protection for istelf and that of its master. It was custom for its future master to be the first to see it when it broke free from its shell."
2527,Sanguinating Totem,"After the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the blood god. They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a totem, which when concentrated upon, would drain not just the life from their enemies, but also their blood, infusing the caster with it and altering them in unusual ways. This was the dawn of who the Zandalari call, ""The Blood Trolls""."
2528,Dance of the Dead,"When the Drust wished to enchant the minds of their enemies, or prey, they would often do so subtly by leaving small tokens around their targets. Curious objects, when focused on by the holder, would summon a haunting vision of a dancing spectre. This spectre would entrance all who watched it, rendering them docile and easy to dispatch."
2529,Restored Revenant,"As the Drust became more skilled at trapping souls within objects, so did they become more adept at creating constructs of death in which to trap the souls. Revenants are amongst the fiercest of these creatures. Stripped of memory and any semblance of self, their bodies constructed from pieces that can no longer decompose, these creatures never tire and will hunt their prey for all eternity."
2530,Fetish of the Tormented Mind,"This fetish was paramount for twisting the minds of their enemies, causing doubt to grow like a weed within the target, encroaching brighter thoughts. Those afflicted would question their motivations, their ideals, or their courage and would often find themselves at the end of a Drust blade before finally rediscovering their resolve."
