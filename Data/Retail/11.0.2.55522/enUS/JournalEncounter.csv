90,Helix Gearbreaker,"Formerly a craftsman in the Bilgewater Cartel, Helix was offered a sum eclipsing anything he would ever make as a nameless Horde engineer to ply his trade for the Defias Brotherhood.

171,Atramedes,"Atramedes, or Experiment 25463-D, is a failed attempt to bestow enhanced senses on a black dragon whelp. The toxic salve applied to the broodling robbed him of sight, forcing him to rely on sound and smell for survival. A tragic story... if Atramedes weren't so evil."

186,Akil'zon,"As a former shaman of the Amani tribe, Akil'zon had a preternatural ability when working with the element of air. This talent caught the eye of Hex Lord Malacrass and made finding a host for the trolls' eagle god an easy task."

193,Lord Rhyolith,"Rhyolith is one of the most ancient elementals in existence, born from the primordial fires that forged Azeroth itself.

198,Ragnaros,"Ragnaros, lord of the Firelands, embodies the fury and destruction of the primordial infernos that forged Azeroth itself.

289,Murozond,"Now living outside of time, Murozond was once the great Dragon Aspect Nozdormu the Timeless One.

291,Queen Azshara,"The songs of Queen Azshara's beauty, majesty, and power are too numerous to count, but it was her vanity that drove the Highborne to summon the Burning Legion.

317,Hagara the Stormbinder,"Hagara, one of the first students of arcane magic under the Forsaken, showed surprising potential for one who had started learning so late in life. But in her undisciplined attempts to bind elementals into servitude, she was ensnared and twisted by the Windlord, Al'Akir. Now fiercely loyal to the Twilight's Hammer, Hagara binds others for her elemental masters to torment."
318,Spine of Deathwing,"When Deathwing first channeled the Dragon Soul's power against the other flights, the massive energies that were unleashed threatened to break apart his very body.  Rather than forgo this weapon, he had adamantium plates fused to his scales to hold his body together. Later reinforced with elementium, these plates are now his weakness--the sole vulnerability to Deathwing's lethal presence."
322,Arcurion,"Horde and Alliance assaults against the Twilight's Hammer have slaughtered many of the cult's fearsome elemental ascendants.

324,Warlord Zon'ozz,"Countless ages ago, Warlord Zon'ozz and his soldiers waged endless war against the forces of C'Thun and Yogg-Saron.

325,Yor'sahj the Unsleeping,"Since the fall of the Bastion of Twilight, Yor'sahj the Unsleeping has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor'sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service."
331,Ultraxion,"More an abomination of dark energy than a dragon, Ultraxion has spent his short life absorbing the essence of captured nether dragons.

Loyal to his master, Ultraxion swears to bring about the fall of Wyrmrest Temple."
332,Warmaster Blackhorn,"Though once vast in number, only a few dozen twilight dragons now remain. Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight's Hammer's army: the elite drake riders of Deathwing's personal escort. Led by the insidious Warmaster Blackhorn, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master."
333,Madness of Deathwing,"A warped mass of molten hatred and unfathomable power, this formless, mindless horror cannot be stopped.

Her transfer to Baradin Hold prior to the Cataclysm has only aggravated the ruined prison's increasingly dire conditions."
340,Echo of Baine,"Enraged by his failure to protect the world and, most importantly, the Horde, this time-ravaged shade of Baine Bloodhoof lingers within the ruins of the Obsidian Dragonshrine. Although he's still as powerful as the tauren high chieftain from the present, within this shattered future Azeroth, this guilt-ridden echo is little more than a discordant vessel of unquenchable malice and anger."
341,Archbishop Benedictus,"Archbishop Benedictus is the revered leader of the Church of the Holy Light. For years, his wise guidance has been instrumental in seeing humanity through bleak times. Yet beneath his apparent benevolence lies the shocking truth that Benedictus has pledged himself to the eradication of all life on Azeroth through the agency of his dark master... Deathwing."
342,Asira Dawnslayer,"Former blade-for-hire Asira Sunbright was initially leery of working for the Twilight's Hammer, but the cult's generous payments quickly won her over.

369,High Interrogator Gerstahn,"The Twilight's Hammer cultist Gerstahn has always indulged in life's finer things: exotic foods, fine clothes, and gem-encrusted torture tools.

Gerstahn proudly calls this horrific noise her symphony of screams, and she is always eager to add another voice to the chorus."
370,Lord Roccor,"Lord Roccor loathes the scheming and backstabbing of his fellow fire elementals. To avoid serving alongside his kind in the Molten Core, the mighty being purposefully angered the Firelord. Roccor's risky gambit paid off: he was expelled from the core and forced to guard Blackrock Depths in isolation."
371,Houndmaster Grebmar,"Grebmar Fleabeard's hounds are the only family he's ever known. Long ago, the orphaned dwarf began breeding canines to serve as companions and guard dogs.

372,Ring of Law,"There is only one punishment for crimes committed against the Dark Iron dwarves: death.

To date, it is unknown if anyone has ever survived this brutal crucible."
373,Pyromancer Loregrain,"Once a respected member of the Earthen Ring, Loregrain joined the Twilight's Hammer cult for reasons that remain a mystery to his former allies. He eventually journeyed to Blackrock Depths, where he took a sudden interest in the famed Dark Iron architect Franclorn Forgewright.

The ghost of the late chief architect seeks to reclaim his incredibly powerful hammer--Ironfel--from Darkvire before it can be used for ill."
377,Bael'Gar,"The monstrous molten giant Bael'Gar lumbers across the Dark Iron Highway, a stunning feat of dwarven engineering carved into Blackrock Depths. Ragnaros pulled the giant from the heart of the Firelands to guard a massive sealed door at one end of the highway. According to legend, only the Firelord and the Dark Iron clan's highest-ranking members know what lies beyond the mysterious gate."
378,General Angerforge,"Through a lifetime of study, General Angerforge has become an expert on dwarven military history and tactics. He recently incurred Emperor Dagran Thaurissan's fury by writing a scathing treatise on his clan's failures in past conflicts. This political blunder aside, Angerforge is a Dark Iron to his core. He will bleed--and die, if necessary--to protect his people and his emperor."
379,Golem Lord Argelmach,Argelmach's lifelong obsession with immortality drove him to forge enchanted constructs in his own image. Rumor has it that he has also dabbled in some form of black magic that would allow the golem lord's new creations to act as vessels for his spirit should his flesh-and-blood body be destroyed.
380,Hurley Blackbreath,"To say Blackbreath is a regular at the Grim Guzzler would be something of an understatement. In over a decade, the mischievous drunkard has left the tavern only once to steal a top-secret recipe for Thunderbrew Lager. Blackbreath has occasionally sobered up enough to make the concoction himself, and he claims it grants unimaginable strength and courage."
381,Phalanx,"Until recently, drunken brawls raged within the Grim Guzzler on an almost daily basis. Barkeep Plugger Spazzring has reduced the frequency of these scuffles with Phalanx, a mighty golem bouncer programmed to maintain order in the tavern and eliminate raucous patrons with extreme force."
383,Plugger Spazzring,"They say that at the Grim Guzzler everyone knows your name. This sense of camaraderie is due to the hard work of Spazzring, a leper gnome who sought a new life in Blackrock Depths after the fall of Gnomeregan. Despite his history of dabbling with evil as a warlock, he takes pride in his job as the tavern's barkeep, making sure that his patrons' mugs never run dry."
384,Ambassador Flamelash,"For his unwavering service to Ragnaros, Flamelash ascended to the rank of ambassador to the Dark Iron clan. This depraved being initially despised his dwarven allies, but he has come to respect their penchant for destruction. As a show of solidarity, Flamelash guards the Chamber of Enchantment, a sacred location used by the dwarves to empower their weaponry."
385,The Seven,"Centuries ago, sorcerer-thane Thaurissan and seven of his most powerful Dark Iron allies accidentally summoned Ragnaros into Azeroth and damned their entire clan to enslavement. Although the Seven perished during the ritual, their restless spirits still linger in Blackrock Depths, cursed to serve their elemental master and the current Dark Iron ruler."
386,Magmus,"Ambassador Flamelash charged the molten giant Magmus with guarding Emperor Dagran Thaurissan's throne room, but not even this act put the Dark Iron ruler's concerns to rest. Ever fearful of assassins, the emperor also granted Magmus control over a series of fire-breathing statues outside his royal chambers."
387,Emperor Dagran Thaurissan,"Emperor Dagran Thaurissan rules alongside Princess Moira of the rival Bronzebeard clan. Debate rages over whether the emperor ensorcelled his bride or she willingly joined him. Whatever the truth, Thaurissan's continued presence bodes ill for the future of his clan. So long as he lives, the Dark Irons will remain pawns of Ragnaros, and a dire threat to kingdoms throughout Azeroth."
388,Highlord Omokk,"Omokk rules over the spire's ogres with an iron fist. Many underlings have challenged him to single combat in the hopes of seizing the highlord's title, but all have fallen without landing a solitary blow. This mysterious phenomenon has led to rumors that dark magic is protecting Omokk."
389,Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin,"Vosh'gajin is renowned for her beauty--and psychotic tendencies--among the trolls. A master of the shadow hunter arts, she wields formidable hexes, curses, and healing magics."
390,War Master Voone,"During the Second War, Voone led small strike teams on daring missions into the heart of high elven territory. The cunning troll joined the false Horde because he wanted to be its chief strategist, not because he believed in Blackhand's ideology. Voone sees the splinter faction as an underdog, and he enjoys the satisfaction of overcoming insurmountable odds."
391,Mother Smolderweb,"Centuries ago, the Dark Iron dwarves dug into the lair of Mother Smolderweb, releasing the massive arachnid into the spire's halls. Her brood has continued to swell in number since that time, so much so that even Blackhand's forces fear traveling through Smolderweb's domain."
392,Urok Doomhowl,"Doomhowl is the true leader of the spire's ogres. This sinister figure has charmed his trusted aid, Highlord Omokk, with insidious magic to control Doomhowl's minions in his stead. He has gone to great lengths to keep up this charade, ruthlessly killing any ogres who challenge the highlord's rule."
393,Quartermaster Zigris,"After the First War, the orc hunter Zigris became infamous for tracking down Stormwind refugees and slaughtering them like game. He loathes Blackrock Spire's claustrophobic halls, but he is certain a day will come when he'll hunt in the open air again."
394,Halycon,"Halycon comes from a long line of great worgs bred for their ferocity and loyalty. Over the years, the den mother has produced an astonishing number of savage offspring. Rumors have spread that she is a demonic hound gifted to Rend Blackhand by a pit lord of the Burning Legion."
395,Gizrul the Slavener,"Very few of the Dark Horde have seen the reclusive and unpredictable Gizrul. The beast emerges from his shadowy den only when his mate, Halycon, calls to him. The two monstrous creatures have produced some of the largest--and most ferocious--worgs ever bred in orcish history."
396,Overlord Wyrmthalak,"The black dragonspawn Wyrmthalak oversees the lower spire's forces as they prepare for their assault against the dwarves. He has no love for the false Horde or its brutish members, and he will sacrifice any number of Blackhand's minions to protect his master, Nefarian."
402,Zevrim Thornhoof,"Desperate to show his worth to the Burning Legion, Zevrim Thornhoof told his masters he could enslave the formidable ancients who still roamed Dire Maul. When his own power proved insufficient, Thornhoof turned to other living creatures for additional energy, butchering them atop his sacrificial altar and harvesting their essence in their final, agonizing moments."
403,Hydrospawn,"When the satyr Zevrim Thornhoof sought to control the elementals in Dire Maul, he focused on Hydrospawn, who calmly resided in the pool beneath his altar. As he performed his profane sacrificial rituals, the elemental grew agitated and restless, striking out at Thornhoof's demonic minions. As the years passed, Thornhoof used his victims' energies to whip Hydrospawn into unbridled fury, little by little binding its will to the satyr's commands."
404,Lethtendris,"Dire Maul's warped energy drew Lethtendris from afar, giving her hope of satisfying her unbearable craving for arcane magic. Using the sinews and ligaments of sacrificial victims, she constructed a web to siphon the corrupt power out of the east wing. To her delight, she discovered that the device has the capacity to gather vast reserves of overwhelming strength, enough to destroy all of her enemies."
405,Alzzin the Wildshaper,"Alzzin the Wildshaper seeks nothing less than the total corruption of Feralas, but until he discovered the Shrine of Eldretharr in Dire Maul, he had little success. With the power of enslaved ancients at his command, Alzzin concentrated the vitality of the surrounding forest into his lair, allowing him to manipulate it at will."
406,Tendris Warpwood,"Tendris Warpwood was a staunch defender of Eldre'Thalas, his heart inexorably entwined with the fate of the city. When the Sundering shattered the land, his resolve never wavered, but as corruption seeped into the ruins over the next 10,000 years, so too did it infect the ancient's spirit."
407,Illyanna Ravenoak,"Illyanna Ravenoak, along with her faithful companion Ferra, was once Prince Tortheldrin's most valued hunter, until she refused to carry out her leader's order to execute her friends. As punishment, he killed Illyanna and her bear, but he used his demonic power to bind their spirits to their bodies, condemning them to remain in Dire Maul as undead protectors."
408,Magister Kalendris,"When Prince Tortheldrin demanded the slaughter of the majority of his subjects, his most loyal lieutenants were tasked with executing his will. Magister Kalendris murdered many unsuspecting Shen'dralar without hesitation, but one of the doomed elves mortally wounded him during a destructive battle. Despite his demise, Kalendris's spirit still roams Dire Maul as a defender of Tortheldrin's rule."
409,Immol'thar,"In a desperate bid to restore the power and immortality they lost when the Well of Eternity was destroyed, the Shen'dralar summoned a demon into the western wing of Dire Maul and captured him within a force field, allowing them to use the void terror's energy for their own spells. Unable to fight back or even move for nearly 10,000 years, Immol'thar could only watch and wait for the day he might break free and rend the flesh of his captors."
410,Prince Tortheldrin,"After the Well of Eternity's destruction, Prince Tortheldrin maintained control over the surviving Shen'dralar by imprisoning a demon in the ruins of Eldre'Thalas and letting his subjects siphon its strength. The exposure to demonic power twisted Tortheldrin's mind, and when the creature faltered, the prince ordered the deaths of many of his vassals so only he and his most fanatical followers would be left to enjoy the corrupt energy."
411,Guard Mol'dar,"Mol'dar is a zealously loyal guard from the Gordok ogres. He is convinced King Gordok gifted him with a pair of enchanted gauntlets that have enabled him to become his people's arm wrestling champion for six years running. In truth, King Gordok threw the powerful armor away; Mol'dar simply found it first."
412,Stomper Kreeg,"On more than one occasion, skulking assassins have met their doom after accidentally disturbing Kreeg's ale mug. Though he's often passed out drunk on duty, nothing rouses the ogre into a berserker fury faster than the sound of his precious drink splattering on the stone floor."
413,Guard Fengus,"Ever since Cho'Rush the Observer told him he was destined to meet a mate while on duty, Fengus has spent almost every waking moment patrolling Gordok territory."
414,Guard Slip'kik,"Some might think Slip'kik is merely cautious, but he's also lazy. Rather than challenge King Gordok directly, Slip'kik tinkers with traps and old, broken magical devices, hoping to eventually deliver a coup de grace without an ounce of risk or a drop of sweat."
415,Captain Kromcrush,"Even among ogres, Captain Kromcrush is infamous for his hair-trigger rage toward anyone who dares to insult him or King Gordok. He crushes dissent ruthlessly, but he has still less patience for those who continue to spread the rumor of his torrid affair with a gnoll long ago."
416,Cho'Rush the Observer,"Cho'Rush doesn't usually take sides, but when Ulrok was rising to power, it was clear there was nobody who could challenge him. The king quickly appointed Cho'Rush as his chief advisor, believing that his twin heads would make him twice as resourceful as the average ogre."
417,King Gordok,"To rule the Gordok ogres, one must simply proclaim oneself king... and then destroy all who might disagree. King Gordok--then merely known as Ulrok--solidified his power by convincing a dozen of his people's strongest warriors to challenge the king at the same time. The wild melee left most of the contestants dead or wounded, and Ulrok's blade easily cut down the survivors and the battle-weary king. To this day, Gordok ogres speak in hushed tones about the ""Day of Da Blood."""
418,Crowd Pummeler 9-60,"In Gnomeregan's heyday, inventors would compete for status by pitting their creations against one another. The mekgineer Oglethorpe Obnoticus built an unbeatable robot, and this earned him respect in the high tinker's court. Sicco Thermaplugg stole Obnoticus's blueprints and then made a giant version of the machine. He set his forgery loose, and the horrific results drove the ruling council to banish the innocent Obnoticus. The Crowd Pummeler 9-60 is still one of Thermaplugg's favorite (stolen) inventions."
419,Grubbis,"The radioactive gas that flooded the city was meant to anger the troggs and kill the gnomes, and Thermaplugg's plan was brutally effective. One trogg, however, reacted oddly to the substance: Grubbis grew. And grew. It was a side effect that Sicco had not anticipated, but he's never been one to waste valuable (and dangerous) resources. This giant trogg now patrols the tunnels of Gnomeregan. His loyal basilisk pet, Chomper, helps Grubbis sniff out gas leaks, tasty fungi, and even tastier intruders."
420,Viscous Fallout,"The formerly robust and elegantly complex waterways of Gnomeregan are now an irradiated mess filled with toxic slime. A lone water elemental who had dwelt in the gnomes' aquifer became trapped in the contamination, and the pollution corrupted its pure form. It currently wanders the halls of Gnomeregan in anger and agony, a liquid embodiment of the vile poison of Thermaplugg's betrayal."
421,Electrocutioner 6000,"Mekgineer Thermaplugg is not a patient gnome. Rather than putting his inventions through a battery of tests to determine their safety and effectiveness, he rushes them into the field and moves on to the next project. The Electrocutioner 6000 was his first attempt at harnessing electricity as a weapon via a super-charged mechano-tank. Lieutenant Tom ""Sizzlepants"" Crankle, the only soldier to survive piloting the Electrocutioner, is now something of a hero among the leper gnomes."
422,Mekgineer Thermaplugg,"Murderer, traitor, and self-proclaimed king of the gnomes, the mekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg rules over the radioactive halls of Gnomeregan with a malfunctioning iron fist. His subjects are numerous, vicious, and insane enough to defend their crazed king against any intrusion from the upper world. It is Thermaplugg's madness that makes him so dangerous; he possesses the cunning to destroy everything around him, with no thought for his own life. There is a reason that even the monsters of Gnomeregan fear him."
423,Noxxion,Noxxion is a living embodiment of corruption. Theradras ordered her ally Lord Vyletongue to create this putrid elemental to be a powerful servant and a loyal pet to ease the princess's loneliness. Noxxion spreads its toxic essence into areas of Maraudon that have not yet withered under Theradras's malign influence.
424,Razorlash,"Razorlash was made to accompany Noxxion through Maraudon. In time, this new creation became one of the princess's most cherished servants. Razorlash constantly wanders the caves alongside Noxxion, using thorny tendrils to shred any untainted plant life it can find."
425,Tinkerer Gizlock,"Tinkerer Gizlock and five other gem hunters snuck into Maraudon to mine its highly prized crystals. Their plan went horribly wrong when satyrs slaughtered everyone in the party save for Gizlock. The goblin, trapped within the caves and driven to the brink of madness, sees himself as the subterranean region's new ruler."
426,Subjugator Kor'ul,"The Twilight Hammer commanded their powerful enforcer, Subjugator Kor'ul, to cleanse the caves of anything not under their control. Gelihast was first to fall under the crushing strength of Kor'ul, who then seized control of the cave dwelling murlocs. Kor'ul left Gelihast's twisted corpse on display as proof of his dominance and now uses the murlocs to hoard the possessions of those who perish in these caves."
427,Lord Vyletongue,"The satyr lord Vyletongue journeyed into Maraudon's depths after hearing of its corruption. Theradras was wary of the conniving demon at first, but Vyletongue proved his worth by creating an array of wretched minions, such as Noxxion and Razorlash, for the princess."
428,Celebras the Cursed,"Upon learning of his uncle's tragic fate, the noble Celebras swore to free Zaetar's spirit. Yet the keeper of the grove was not prepared for the horrors that awaited him in Maraudon's shadowy corridors. The dark energies permeating the area quickly overcame Celebras, filling his heart with uncontrollable rage."
429,Landslide,"For years, the ancient mountain giant known as Landslide cultivated brilliant crystal gardens in Maraudon, but Theradras enthralled the behemoth when she took up residence there. This once-stoic giant now lives only to serve his tyrannical new master."
430,Rotgrip,"Rumor has it that Rotgrip has dwelled in Maraudon's subterranean waters for millennia. The famed dwarven hunter Hemet Nesingwary once proclaimed that the beast could not be found, and a number of amateur trackers accepted the challenge of seeking out the legendary creature. None of them ever returned."
431,Princess Theradras,"The earth elemental Theradras, Therazane the Stonemother's sole daughter, resides in Maraudon's inner sanctum. Influenced by the Old Gods, the princess transformed her home into a den of corruption and suffering. Some believe that her foul powers are tied to the spirit of her dead lover, Zaetar. If so, liberating the fallen keeper of the grove might be the only hope of cleansing Maraudon."
433,Mordresh Fire Eye,"Through necromantic magic Death Speaker Blackthorn was able to rekindle the flames of Mordresh Fire Eye's soul, returning him to undeath.

As a former shaman, Mordresh has exerted his twisted control over the elements.  He burns and scorches all those who threaten the Death Speaker's work."
436,Domina,"When Lady Sarevess failed to provide magical protection, Domina sacrificed the naga to empower her own dark ritual. Unlike her predecessor, Domina, Mistress of the Dark, has no fear of Aku'mai and hand feeds the beast countless innocents in order to curry favor with the Old Gods."
437,Twilight Lord Bathiel,"The Twilight's Hammer do not tolerate failure, so the first command Twilight Lord Bathiel gave once he assumed control of Blackfathom Deeps was to throw Lord Kelris into the hungry maw of Aku'mai.  Now, this elemental ascendant commits the depths of his unfathomable power to raising the beast of the Old Gods and covering the world in black."
443,Hearthsinger Forresten,"The Culling of Stratholme claimed the lives of innumerable people whose only crime was being in the doomed city. A traveling singer and piccolo player named Forresten was one such victim. He continues to wander the city in death, unable to accept his tragic fate."
444,Aku'mai,"Aku'mai, an ancient evil, carries within him a small measure of the Old Gods' power. This three-headed hydra is greatly feared for his mindless savagery and insatiable hunger for living flesh, but the Twilight's Hammer worships him as a divine sign that the Old Gods will soon return."
445,Timmy the Cruel,"Timmison was infamous for his savagery on the field of battle. Some speculate his sadism stemmed from the ceaseless bullying he endured as a child. Now reborn as a Scourge monstrosity, his mind shattered, he is tormented by those memories, causing him to answer to the name he once loathed: Timmy."
446,Willey Hopebreaker,"Balnazzar took great pleasure in leveraging the cannon master Willey's destructive capabilities in undeath, calling his prized minion by the name of Hopebreaker. The dreadlord relishes that he has twisted Willey and other Scarlet Crusaders--who so despised the undead in life--into his unwitting pawns."
447,Guardian of the Deep,"Underneath the cursed Moonshrine Ruins, ancient creatures battle for territory. Old Serra'kis was driven from the ruins by The Guardian of the Deep who was seeking new spawning grounds. Now, the Guardian watches over thousands of eggs until they can hatch, and spread throughout the waterways of Azeroth."
448,Instructor Galford,"Galford once took great pride in caring for the Crusade's most valued documents. However, as he lay dying, he watched in horror as his precious tomes were burnt around him. Balnazzar used this painful memory to imbue his servant with the fiery power that ravaged Galford in life."
449,Balnazzar,"Balnazzar has never tasted true death, but he has suffered bitter defeat. After the Cataclysm rocked the world, he slaughtered the Scarlet Crusaders in Stratholme and transformed them into the undead creatures they once hated. The dreadlord now plots his machinations for vengeance upon Azeroth."
450,The Unforgiven,"Lylia was a blade of righteousness among her people. After Arthas commanded his forces to purge the city, her sanity was ripped apart from seeing countless innocents die by her hand. She fell on her sword to escape the madness around her, and she now exists as a spectral being forever denied absolution for her heinous acts."
451,Baroness Anastari,"While she lived, Anastari took what she wanted, no matter the cost. Death has done little to change that. Her soul ripped from her body, Anastari became a banshee, and she has abandoned her love of material trinkets in favor of possessions of a far more sinister kind."
452,Nerub'enkan,"Nerub'enkan was a fearsome warrior during the War of the Spider. Ultimately, she succumbed to her wounds and was raised into undeath as an obedient minion of the Scourge. Now the nerubian guards a ziggurat in Stratholme as fiercely as she defended her home in life."
453,Maleki the Pallid,"Maleki was among the first to join the Cult of the Damned, showing tremendous aptitude in harnessing the chill of the grave. Driven by an insatiable desire for power, the mage fervently hones his skills in dark magic to prepare for when he will be remade as a lich."
454,Magistrate Barthilas,Barthilas was among those innocents purged by Arthas and his forces during the Culling of Stratholme. The Lich King eventually raised the former magistrate from the grave and commanded the hulking undead monstrosity to guard his ruined home.
455,Ramstein the Gorger,"Ramstein is one of the Scourge's most infamous abominations, a horror stitched together from numerous corpses and empowered by a ceaseless hunger. This monster committed unspeakable atrocities on countless innocent souls when Scourge forces overran Stratholme."
456,Lord Aurius Rivendare,"Aurius's fall from grace was precipitous. Failing to exact retribution from his corrupted father, Baron Rivendare, the former paladin was not granted peace in death. He was tragically reforged into an instrument of the Scourge, the evil he had once sworn to defeat."
457,Avatar of Hakkar,"Hakkar was notorious for demanding sacrifices from his followers. Many millennia ago, he instructed the Atal'ai to bring forth his avatar, using blood ritually drained from living victims to feed him. The Atal'ai priests now seek to raise Hakkar's avatar with a modified version of this ritual, one that involves sacrificing green dragons. If the Atal'ai succeed, the re-emergence of Hakkar's avatar could spell doom for Azeroth."
458,Jammal'an the Prophet,"Jammal'an is the current leader of the Atal'ai, the extremist sect of priests who fanatically worship Hakkar. While in deep meditation, Jammal'an received instructions on how to resurrect Hakkar by using the blood of his draconic foes, the green dragonflight. Jammal'an and his undead bodyguard Ogom the Wretched stand ready to oppose any who would prevent Hakkar's return, though the prophet's actions may unleash upon Azeroth an even more terrible force: the Emerald Nightmare."
459,Wardens of the Dream,"Four promising young drakes accompanied Eranikus into the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, eager to prove themselves by serving a great and powerful wyrm. One by one, they were captured and tainted by the Emerald Nightmare, and they now wander the halls of the Sunken Temple, lashing out at all who intrude upon their waking dream."
463,Shade of Eranikus,"Eranikus, former consort to Ysera the Dreamer, was sent to guard the ruins of Atal'Hakkar and prevent Hakkar's emergence. Once within the temple, he and his retinue were corrupted by its dark forces, and he became a shade, pulled between the realms of the Emerald Dream and the physical plane. Despite his corruption, Eranikus may still call upon his powers as a green dragon to spew corrosive acid at his enemies or trap them in a deep slumber."
464,Hogger,"Convict #SC55: Hogger 

Charges: Too many to list here 

Imprisoning the Riverpaw leader has come at a high cost, including the partial blinding of the warden. Fearing that Hogger might escape, Thelwater has authorized the gnoll's termination with extreme prejudice."
465,Lord Overheat,"Convict #NA: Lord Overheat 

Charges: Homicide (multiple counts) 

The natural disasters wrought by the Cataclysm caused elementals to erupt into the prison complex, slaughtering half of the inmates upon arrival. Removing these incensed threats is imperative to restoring order to the stockade."
466,Randolph Moloch,"Convict #AC317: Randolph Moloch 

Charges: Embezzlement, fraud, theft, and homicide 

Moloch has been identified as the ringleader of the prison revolt. Given his connections to the House of Nobles, however, the use of lethal force to subdue this convict is not authorized."
467,Revelosh,"Some luminaries in Ironforge's prestigious Explorers' League have theorized an ancestral link between their people and the troggs, and pointed towards the troggs' hoarding of titan artifacts as a reflection of the dwarves' own reverence for such wondrous devices. If that is true, the trogg known as Revelosh can be considered the trogg equivalent of an archaeologist, although any historically minded adventurers who encounter him would be more inclined to call him a thief."
468,The Lost Dwarves,"Seeking fame and, more importantly, fortune, the three brothers Eric, Olaf, and Baelog took on a contract from the Explorers' League to delve deep into the halls of Uldaman and clear a path for a group of researchers. For these three dwarves, however, ""clearing a path"" unfortunately entailed ""getting hopelessly lost in an ancient labyrinth."" Proud dwarves to the end, they fight to prevent the secrets of Uldaman and the Explorers' League from falling into the hands of the Horde."
469,Ironaya,"The titans did not construct the Uldaman complex directly, but utilized various servants to create its megalithic halls. The Pantheon entrusted the watcher Ironaya with overseeing the construction and maintenance of Uldaman, but as time passed, the once awe-inspiring vault fell to ruin. Within the map chamber, Ironaya has spent millennia in a form of stasis, analyzing the original master plan drawn up by Khaz'goroth and attempting to find a way to restore the complex to its original functionality."
470,Ancient Stone Keeper,"One of many golems that staffed and operated the great titan vault, the Ancient Stone Keeper was part of a small group that served as an intermediary between the watchers left in control of the facility and their many servants. With the corruption of the Obsidian Sentinel, the Ancient Stone Keeper is the last of its kind, performing its duty by protecting the secrets of the titans as best it can until its inevitable shutdown."
471,Galgann Firehammer,"Reacting to the discovery of Uldaman by Bronzebeard dwarves, the Dark Iron clan mounted an invasion of the vault to stop their ancestral foes from accessing the powerful artifacts within. Galgann Firehammer, a senator from Shadowforge City, was sent to oversee the continued excavation of Uldaman so that the emperor may harness the artifacts' destructive potential against the Dark Irons' enemies."
472,Grimlok,"In trogg society, the biggest, strongest, and most vicious trogg often becomes chieftain through displays of power. Grimlok is a comparative genius in that he has maintained control of the Stonevault troggs through intimidation and what might be considered crude psychological warfare. Having trained a deadly basilisk, Grimlok uses the threat of petrification by his beast to keep any would-be usurpers in line."
473,Archaedas,"Deep within Uldaman is a chamber containing one of the greatest treasures of the titans, created by Norgannon himself. However, thus far no explorers have managed to gain access to the relic, for any attempt at doing so activates the great watcher Archaedas, an immense guardian who easily dispatches treasure seekers through his powerful attacks and a veritable army of servants. Crafted from some of the oldest, strongest stone taken from Uldaman's depths, Archaedas is a foe as formidable as he is ancient."
474,Lady Anacondra,"Scarletleaf was the first to volunteer for Naralex's self-appointed mission to the Barrens. After her master's nightmare shattered her mind, the young acolyte cast aside her name, now envisioning a sinister reptilian future for Azeroth."
475,Lord Cobrahn,"Jarlaxla's skill at harnessing animal forms earned him renown among the druids of the Cenarion Circle. However, the Wailing Caverns' corruption twisted his unique abilities. Now, Jarlaxla has perfected a deadly serpentine form, renaming himself Cobrahn to reflect his vicious newfound power."
476,Lord Pythas,"A childhood friend of Naralex, the warrior Aryn was a quick study in druidism. Despite his training, the acolyte was defenseless against the corruption that would strip away his sanity. Aryn has taken on the name Pythas, combining his impressive melee prowess with his druidic arsenal to vanquish intruders."
477,Kresh,"An ancient resident of the Wailing Caverns, this giant turtle wanders the underground caves, his resilient mind unaffected by Naralex's relentless nightmares. Don't be fooled by his happy disposition; Kresh has thwarted many adventurers who longed to steal his massive shell."
478,Skum,"Skum first journeyed to the Wailing Caverns for relief from the Barrens' hostile environment. Like many of the caves' other inhabitants, he quickly succumbed to corruption. His veins now pulse with dark energies that have transformed him into a mighty and ruthless beast beyond redemption."
479,Lord Serpentis,"The Druids of the Fang's leader was once Naralex's finest student. His tragic downfall stemmed from his desire to become a shan'do, or ""honored teacher,"" like Naralex. As insanity took root, Serpentis rallied his brethren to his side and formed the Druids of the Fang."
480,Verdan the Everliving,"Little is known about this creature prior to Naralex's arrival at the Wailing Caverns. Thought to be the caves' original guardian, Verdan the Everliving could not escape the corruption that befell its home. Verdan is allied with the insane druids and maintains its vigil against those who trespass into its domain."
481,Mutanus the Devourer,"From the darkest corners of Naralex's twisted mind, the corruption plaguing the Emerald Dream has manifested in the form of the druid's worst enemy: murlocs. The aberration known as Mutanus has come to the waking world to devour any who seek to liberate Naralex from the Nightmare's clutches."
483,Gahz'rilla,"Legend has it that Gahz'rilla was an adored pet of the Old Gods, or even a demigod in her own right. Whatever the truth is, the Sandfury trolls have worshiped this monstrous hydra for thousands of years. Ever wary of the beast's icy wrath, the trolls will only rouse Gahz'rilla when they have plentiful sacrifices to sate the ravenous creature's appetite."
484,Antu'sul,"Antu'sul prefers his sul'lithuz basilisks strong and ruthless. He treats these scaled beasts like family, and he is known to strike down anyone--even fellow trolls--who harm his precious children. Rather than give his opponents a proper burial, Antu'sul allows the basilisks to feast on whoever dares cross him."
485,Theka the Martyr,"Long ago, the martyr Theka was slain in the brutal war between the qiraji and the trolls. Zul'Farrak still stands because of his brave sacrifice. Even in death he maintains a vigil over his beloved city, and it is said that the dozens of insectoid warriors who killed him were cursed to live as mindless scarabs, scuttling at the martyr's side."
486,Witch Doctor Zum'rah,"The powerful loa Bwonsamdi watches over the spirits of the Darkspear trolls, but many of the Sandfury tribe's fallen members are offered no such protection after death. These tortured spirits obey Zum'rah, a cruel witch doctor who uses his dark magic to force the city's dead into unending service."
487,Nekrum & Sezz'ziz,"Nekrum Gutchewer has mysteriously lived well past his natural life, but his decaying body remains strong enough to aid Sezz'ziz. Together, these two trolls have gathered sacrifices to the mythic beast Gahz'rilla, who slumbers at the city's heart. Many troll followers eagerly await the terrifying creature's awakening, and they will do anything to see the ritual through."
489,Chief Ukorz Sandscalp,"Chief Ukorz Sandscalp is obsessed with restoring his tribe to its former glory. He was raised on stories of a time when trolls lorded over their ancient lands without interference from goblins, gnomes, pirates, ogres, and other foreign interlopers. Sandscalp has called on his trusted comrade Ruuzlu to help him begin a new chapter in Sandfury history in the only way their tribe knows how: with swift and blinding violence."
523,Shirrak the Dead Watcher,"Shirrak was constructed by Exarch Maladaar to guard over the fallen draenei spirits who wander the Auchenai Crypts. A necrotic mass of eyes, teeth, and tentacles, this undead construct absorbs arcane energy with hungry abandon, and will not suffer the living to pass."
524,Exarch Maladaar,"The sole living remnant of the glory that once strode the halls of Auchenai, Maladaar has been driven mad by the loss of everyone and everything he ever loved. His lunatic dedication to the preservation of their memory has driven him to a mastery of the dark arts."
527,Watchkeeper Gargolmar,"Reviled amongst the denizens of Outland, Gargolmar is known to eat the hearts of those he catches near the Hellfire Citadel whether they were trying to enter or not. Charged by Kargath Bladefist himself with the defense of the ramparts, Watchkeeper Gargolmar is unflinching in his duty."
528,Omor the Unscarred,"Omor the Unscarred was a disciple of Hakkar the Houndmaster, and took charge of the legendary warrior's remaining felhounds  after his master's defeat during the War of the Ancients. Since that time, Omor has never been defeated in single combat.  The venerable demon is Illidan's envoy to the fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel."
529,Vazruden the Herald,"Vazruden guards the vital line of supplies, messages, and forces flowing between Hellfire Citidel and the Black Temple.  Astride his magnificent nether drake Nazan, Vazruden presents an unstoppable aerial force of fire, claws, and shrieking terror."
530,Selin Fireheart,"Once a respected captain of Kael'Thas Sunstrider's personal guard, Selin Fireheart has maintained an unswervingly fierce loyalty to his lord while losing his sanity. Selin has been seduced by the demonic energies of the crystals which surround his chamber, and cannot stop from reveling in their vile power. He will slay any who dare approach the Magister's Terrace and will drink the magic, life, and blood from their dead bodies."
531,Vexallus,"An arcane elemental of unimaginable power, Vexallus was summoned to the Magister's Terrace by a trio of blood elves who were slain by the force of his arrival. The magical energy in the surrounding crystals resonates within Vexallus, and his being is in a constant state of explosive chaotic flux."
532,Priestess Delrissa,"Delrissa is a shivarra priestess acting under the demon lord Kil'jaeden. It is Delrissa who revived Kael'thas Sunstrider after he was heavily wounded in an attack on Tempest Keep, and she has stayed in the blood elf lord's presence ever since. The priestess has a militant circle of loyal acolytes who serve her and will defend her at all cost."
533,Kael'thas Sunstrider,"Once a true champion to the blood elf people, and a defender of the race's ancient heritage, Kael'thas Sunstrider has fallen prey to the dark influences of the demon Kil'jaeden while sojourning in Outland. At the bidding of his new master, the wayward prince returned to Azeroth and seized the Sunwell, hoping to use the fount as a means to open a doorway for the demon to this new and verdant world. Kael'thas is a brilliant tactician, a powerful warrior, and his veins burn with limitless fel magic."
534,Pandemonius,"This infamous Void Lord is also known as the Duke of Chaos, the Eater of Nations, and Worldslayer. Pandemonius was one of the commanders serving under Dimensius when the ethereal homeworld of K'aresh was destroyed. He was later bound by Nexus-Prince Shaffar and forced to continue sating his unending hunger in service to the ethereals."
535,Tavarok,"Under the command of Kael'thas Sunstrider, Pathaleon the Calculator summoned a powerful colossus to gather the arcane energies flowing from beneath the Mana Tombs. Tavarok has unexpectedly been transformed by the unique emanations, losing the red-tinged corruption of Pathaleon's influence. The white colossus has gained his own free will and uses it to greedily consume all who would stand in his way."
536,Yor,"A ""gift"" from Illidan Stormrage to accompany Nexus-Prince Shaffar, Yor is a void hound of unlimited savagery and power.  The prince's advisors warned him that Illidan's demonic gift was most likely a ruse set to betray Shaffar once he had met his goals. The prince fed those advisors to Yor... but has since kept the hound in a stasis chamber, just in case."
537,Nexus-Prince Shaffar,"Convinced that vast riches lay within the depths of the Mana Tombs, Nexus-Prince Shaffar has spent untold amounts of his own considerable fortune to move an army into the shadowed halls of this crumbling ruin, and to keep competing ethereals out. The prince's greed knows no bounds, and he has vowed to uncover the mysteries of the Mana Tombs or die trying."
538,Lieutenant Drake,"Lieutenant Drake was an ambitious military man, with his eyes set upon the glory of command during the Second War. His ambition was only matched by his hatred for the green-skinned orcs who had slain so many of his companions, a hatred which took form in his cruel treatment of the prisoners in the internment camps of Durnholde Keep."
539,Captain Skarloc,"Fiercely loyal to Aedelas Blackmoore, Captain Skarloc rose through the ranks of the Durnholde military alongside his friend Aliden Perenolde.  When Aliden decided to take up operations in the Alterac Mountains, Skarloc stayed with his Lord and mentor. He became Aedelas's most trusted comrade and advisor, earning the title ""Blackmoore's Spear."""
540,Epoch Hunter,"The mysteriously-named Epoch Hunter is an assassin from the infinite dragonflight sent to alter the course of history by killing Thrall before he can escape from Durnholde. The shadowy drake has slain countless beings in service of his cause, but this will be his most important kill. He will summon every ounce of his strength, power, subtlety, and cunning to bring about the end of this timeline."
541,Darkweaver Syth,"Darkweaver Syth is charged by the Talon King Ikiss to defend the Sethekk Halls while the renegade arakkoa search for their enigmatic god. A master of shadowy magic, this wizened trickster has learned how to bend the very elements to his sway."
542,Anzu,"A mysterious avian deity worshipped by some of the more savage arakkoa, Anzu is a being whose origins and powers are unlike any other member of Outland's fallen pantheon. The Naaru are silent regarding this malevolent creature, for Anzu's ways are hidden from even them."
543,Talon King Ikiss,"Talon King Ikiss was the charismatic spiritual leader of the daring group of arakkoa which left their home in the Terokkar forest in search of a ""promised god."" He had received dreams of this god as he slept, and knew that revelation lay within the crumbling halls of Auchindoun. Ikiss was driven insane by the visions, and now declares himself to be Terokk reborn, a divine hero from arakkoa myth."
544,Ambassador Hellmaw,"A powerful demonic servant and acolyte of pain, Ambassador Hellmaw is dedicated to the art of death. He loves nothing more than the taste of a mortal's lifeblood tinged with horror and despair.  Hellmaw is bound by the fel orcs of the Shadow Labyrinth and fed a constant stream of prisoners, bolstering the demon to serve the black will of his masters."
545,Blackheart the Inciter,"When the orcish Horde first invaded Azeroth through the Dark Portal, two Shadow Council members instead turned their attentions to the ancient draenei burial grounds of Auchindoun. The unquiet spirits in the area proved to be excellent subjects for the warlock Blackheart to perfect his mind control abilities."
546,Grandmaster Vorpil,"In the early days of the Horde, Grandmaster Vorpil convinced the orc warlock Gul'dan to allow him to investigate the mysteries of Auchindoun, secretly desiring to harness the energy of the frighteningly powerful cosmic essences that permeated the area."
547,Murmur,"""In the beginning""... ""So far away""... such phrases cannot begin to describe this elemental's origin. Its existence heralds pure destruction. Worlds shatter and the pieces scatter at its whim. Only the truly mad would think to summon it. Perhaps there is yet time to banish Murmur before it fully enters Outland."
548,Zereketh the Unbound,"Most creatures from the Twisting Nether require constant directions from their masters, but a select few voidwraiths need no such orders. Zereketh stands at the entrance to Arcatraz, ready to slay all who would dare challenge him."
549,Dalliah the Doomsayer,"Before she was imprisoned by the naaru, Dalliah was one of the most vicious and aggressive warriors within the Burning Legion. Spending so much time as a cellmate to Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates did not improve her disposition either."
550,Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates,"Millennia ago, Soccothrates held a position of honor among the Wrathguards, standing at the side of the Burning Legion's top commanders. Confinement did not suit his considerable ego. Neither did his cellmate."
551,Harbinger Skyriss,"The naaru believed the persuasive voice of Harbinger Skyriss was silenced when they contained him and forced him into a long, dreamless sleep. The unfortunate warden of Arcatraz learned the naaru were wrong. Skyriss had just enough energy to speak to Warden Mellichar in a still, small voice. Time took care of the rest."
552,Chrono Lord Deja,"The Infinite Dragonflight tempted many drakonid with promises of power, but most found only servitude and despair. One of the few exceptions is Chrono Lord Deja, who gained influence within the flight through his raw power and cunning."
553,Temporus,"Although relatively young, Temporus was instrumental in identifying many of the Infinite Dragonflight's prime targets.  As a reward, he was given the responsibility of destroying anyone who might attempt to interfere with the dragonflight's plans."
554,Aeonus,"Powerful and wild, Aeonus was tasked by the Master of the Infinite Dragonflight to personally oversee the disruption of key moments in the true timeway."
555,The Maker,"All creatures who use the power of fel magic, willingly or otherwise, slowly take on the appearance of demons. The Maker accelerates their corruption and performs cruel experiments on any who attempt to resist."
556,Broggok,"Some creatures occasionally have second thoughts about their allegiance to their new, corrupt masters. Broggok ensures that any subversive notions among the fel orcs are permanently eradicated."
557,Keli'dan the Breaker,"When Illidan overthrew the pit lord Magtheridon and took control of Outland, he had the demonic leader imprisoned beneath the Hellfire Citadel. Only the most stalwart among Illidan's forces could ever hope to keep him contained; the ruthless orc, Keli'dan, was the only possible choice."
558,Commander Sarannis,"When the fallen blood elf leader, Kael'thas, seized control of the Tempest Keep, he immediately ordered Commander Sarannis to prepare defenses against whomever the naaru might send to reclaim the keep."
559,High Botanist Freywinn,"Mere minutes after entering the Botanica, Freywinn began conducting reckless experiments in order to unlock the power hidden among the native plant life of Outland."
560,Thorngrin the Tender,"Experiments require resources. Thorngrin the Tender makes sure that Kael'thas's botanists have the power and essence they need to reveal the naaru's secrets, even if that means untold numbers of living creatures must be sacrificed to obtain it."
561,Laj,"The naaru gathered samples of unusual wildlife from across Outland. Their safeguards were destroyed when the Botanica was invaded, leaving some of the most dangerous specimens free to roam."
562,Warp Splinter,"The night elves of Darnassus have asked for help in restoring an Ancient of the Arcane, who found itself trapped in Tempest Keep. Frightened by the recent attack by Kael'thas Sunstrider's forces, the Warp Splinter is unable to differentiate friend from foe and is liable to attack any who disturb it."
563,Mechano-Lord Capacitus,It takes a tremendous amount of skill and precision to harvest the power of the naaru's manacells. These talents can easily be turned upon any intruders.
564,Nethermancer Sepethrea,"Thanks to her skills at quickly summoning creatures to destroy any enemies, Sepethrea was chosen as an apprentice to Pathaleon the Calculator, the blood elf in charge of the Mechanar."
565,Pathaleon the Calculator,"Following the Sunwell's defilement, the vainglorious arcanist Pathaleon saw an opportunity to gain renown by aiding Kael'thas in finding a cure for his race's addiction to magic. This single-minded quest led him to join the blood elf prince on Outland and oversee his disastrous experiments. Most recently, Pathaleon has begun harnessing the Tempest Keep's otherworldly technologies in pursuit of fame and power."
566,Grand Warlock Nethekurse,"Nethekurse, once a shaman of the Shadowmoon clan, abandoned his reverence for the elements to master the art of wielding fel magic. The demonic energies at his command have left him a husk who finds delight only in torturing young fel orcs to test the limits of their mental and physical strength."
568,Warbringer O'mrogg,"The ruthless and cunning ogre O'mrogg is considered one of the Fel Horde's deadliest members. But this feared brute has a problem. The ogre's two heads have always struggled to agree on even the simplest matters. Two years ago, O'mrogg began a twelve-step plan to develop a synergy between his warring personalities. His heads have yet to decide on which step to start with."
569,Warchief Kargath Bladefist,"Chieftain of the Shattered Hand clan and warchief of the Fel Horde, Kargath is one of the greatest orcish heroes in recent memory. Over the years, he has severed both of his hands and replaced them with weapons of war, a bloody ritual unique to his clan. The joy he derives from inflicting pain on both others and himself is legendary among the orcs. As the Fel Horde's tyrannical ruler, he has channeled his ruthlessness and ferocity into forging an unstoppable army within the iron walls of Hellfire Citadel."
570,Mennu the Betrayer,"Mennu is one of the Broken, draenei twisted and deformed by demonic energies unleashed by the orcs. When the naga invaded Zangarmarsh, many of these tragic beings desperately attempted to escape the region. Mennu, however, chose a different path to freedom. In exchange for his own life, he betrayed his fellow Broken to the serpentine invaders and agreed to lord over his kin as a slave driver."
571,Rokmar the Crackler,"Following Draenor's destruction, Rokmar fled into the depths of Zangarmarsh. The energies that had torn the world apart enveloped the behemoth, bolstering its strength and size at the price of constant agony. The naga were awed by Rokmar's ferocity when they first arrived in the region. Rather than kill the beast, they enslaved it and used the creature to subjugate much of Zangarmarsh's indigenous life."
572,Quagmirran,"Quagmirran was once a ruler of Zangarmarsh's immense fungal giants. He was captured by the naga while wandering the region's serpentine caverns and subjected to excruciating torture. Now this broken being serves his overlords without question, silencing all who oppose the will of Lady Vashj."
573,Hydromancer Thespia,"At the height of the night elf empire, the Highborne Thespia delighted in art and music. Her love of these things vanished during the Great Sundering, when she and many of her kin were sucked into Azeroth's deeps and transformed into hateful naga. In the millennia that followed, Thespia remained a close confidant of her childhood friend, Lady Vashj. Without hesitation, she journeyed with her comrade to Zangarmarsh and vowed to oversee the naga's quest to drain the region's water supply."
574,Mekgineer Steamrigger,"The irradiation of Gnomeregan transformed many of the city's survivors into leper gnomes. Among these victims was the brilliant Mekgineer Steamrigger. Although he escaped Gnomeregan and retained his intellect, whatever ethics and compassion he had once possessed were gone. He wandered Azeroth, selling his knowledge to a number of unscrupulous groups such as the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Recently, the naga hired Steamrigger to operate the intricate machinery in Zangarmarsh's Steamvault."
575,Warlord Kalithresh,"Deep within the Steamvault, the naga have begun experimenting with a mysterious substance to strengthen their warriors and purge them of fear. Kalithresh was one of Lady Vashj's first servants to volunteer as a test subject for this dark elixir. As reward, he has been charged with guarding the expansive Steamvault and ensuring the region's arcane machinery operates without interruption."
576,Hungarfen,"Unlike his ally, Quagmirran, the great fungal giant Hungarfen has thus far eluded enslavement by the naga. Nonetheless, he remains aggressive to all outsiders who tread into the deepest caverns of Zangarmarsh. Oblivious to the naga's machinations in other parts of the region, Hungarfen spends much of his time tending the Underspore, an ancient plant said to be his most prized possession."
577,Ghaz'an,"Historians have long disagreed about whether the immense hydras of Azeroth and Outland share a common ancestor. What is clear, however, is that these ruthless creatures have existed on both realms since ancient times. Ghaz'an is one of the most infamous and fearsome hydras on Outland. Under the control of Lady Vashj, this ravenous fiend has stormed the lower reaches of Zangarmarsh to terrorize the region's denizens."
578,Swamplord Musel'ek,"To be one of the Broken is to be an outcast. This truth weighs heavy on Swamplord Musel'ek. Although he is a member of the Murkblood Broken, he prefers to roam the caverns beneath Zangarmarsh alone. During one of these recent wanderings, he used his mastery over beasts to enthrall Windcaller Claw, a druid who had been exploring the area in the form of a ferocious bear. Musel'ek has forced Claw to act as a loyal companion who will not judge him for the twisted being he has become."
579,The Black Stalker,"The marsh walkers of Outland are towering creatures that prowl the wilds, feasting on any lesser creatures they come across. The sporelings of Zangarmarsh tell tales concerning one of these predators, a particularly ruthless beast known as the Black Stalker. Broodmother to all marsh walkers, it is said she emerges from her lair deep in the Underbog only to satisfy her hunger for delicious sporelings."
580,Elder Nadox,"Nadox was once a venerated nerubian leader who taught the ancient ways of his race to generations of broods. When the War of the Spider ravaged Azjol-Nerub, he was overcome by legions of undead. The Lich King reanimated his corpse and bled everything wise and noble from Nadox, forcing him to slaughter his students, friends, and all other nerubians who opposed the might of the Scourge."
581,Prince Taldaram,"After Kael'thas's failed assault against the Lich King, some of his greatest blood elf followers were slaughtered and raised into undeath as darkfallen. Prince Taldaram is one of these cunning and bloodthirsty vampiric beings. Always seeking to please the Lich King, he has entered the war-torn depths of Ahn'kahet in search of lost nerubian relics that can empower the Scourge's murderous ranks."
582,Jedoga Shadowseeker,"Jedoga dreams of apocalypse. She is rumored to be one of the most fanatical adherents of the Twilight's Hammer. Under the guidance of the ruthless ogre mage Cho'gall, she learned to twist her shamanic powers to serve the Old Gods. Not long ago, Jedoga journeyed into the bowels of Ahn'kahet to prepare for the glorious day when Yogg-Saron will arise and envelop the lands of Azeroth in shadow."
583,Amanitar,"For ages, fungi and other benign forms of life have thrived in Ahn'kahet's damp sun-starved caverns. Only recently has Yogg-Saron spread its oppressive will into this isolated ecosystem. The Old God used its immense corruptive powers to warp one of Ahn'kahet's native beasts into a monstrous creature known as Amanitar, an unthinking terror bristling with the destructive energies of its master."
584,Herald Volazj,"Amid the Scourge's invasion of Azjol-Nerub, many of the kingdom's denizens tunneled underground to escape the Lich King's minions. Yet some of them dug too deep, exposing the tendrils of Yogg-Saron. Roused by this disturbance, the entity has sent one of its most ancient warriors - Herald Volazj - to cull the beleaguered nerubians and annihilate anyone foolish enough to threaten the Old God."
585,Krik'thir the Gatewatcher,"The gates of Azjol-Nerub stood unchallenged for centuries until the arrival of the Lich King. In mockery of Krik'thir's inability to protect his home, the nerubian was raised into undeath and forced to protect the very gates he failed to guard successfully in life."
586,Hadronox,"During the fall of Azjol-Nerub, nerubian viziers released a single spider that would one day grow to challenge the unyielding forces of the Lich King. Hadronox was instilled with a desire to avenge the fallen and reclaim its home from any that dare threaten it."
587,Anub'arak,"The fates of Azjol-Nerub and Anub'arak have long been intertwined.  In life, he was the empire's king. In death, he was its conqueror. Charged by the Lich King to protect his old empire once more, the traitor king stands vigilant against any that threaten his kingdom."
588,Trollgore,The Drakkari were among the most vicious troll tribes and Trollgore was a paragon of the tribe's savagery. This hulking monstrosity discovered that his vaunted ferocity paled in comparison to the Lich King's and he now serves as a grisly warning to all that dare challenge Arthas' reign.
589,Novos the Summoner,Novos was ever the opportunist and sought a means to rise above his mundane peers. The cultist carved his heart from his body and presented the still beating organ to his master seconds before his death. His initiative impressed his master who in turn remade him into a lich.
590,King Dred,"King Dred is a legend amongst the Drakkari. Stories tell of a troll hunting party locating a mighty beast that thrived in a habitat saturated with Scourge plague. The trolls tamed the devilsaur, believing that he alone held an antidote for the savage disease devastating their people."
591,The Prophet Tharon'ja,Not even the stolen powers of a loa could stay death's hand as the Scourge marched on Drak'Tharon Keep. Tharon'ja now prophesies only triumph for his new master as legions of trolls are slaughtered before the Lich King.
592,Slad'ran,"Slad'ran took no pleasure in sacrificing the loa he had served all his life. As the powers of his god surged into him, the high prophet swore that the Scourge would suffer for the atrocities the Drakkari trolls were forced to commit."
593,Drakkari Colossus,"The trolls' use of mojo in their voodoo magic has long been established, but the fusion of those magics into a golem was a revolutionary breakthrough. Their initial success led to the creation of numerous sentinels all spawned from their original creation: the colossus."
594,Moorabi,"The Drakkari sought to sacrifice Mam'toth for his powers, but instead the loa destroyed himself. Despite this act, Moorabi would not be denied his god-like powers. The high prophet drank of the loa's blood and will now stop at nothing to keep Zul'Drak firmly in troll hands."
595,Eck the Ferocious,"The Drakkari sealed their failed gorloc experiments away after numerous attempts to weaponize them. As the frost trolls battled the Scourge invading their beloved homeland, Eck and his minions awaited the moment their freedom was at hand."
596,Gal'darah,"The Drakkari turned to their loa as the Scourge invaded the nation of Zul'Drak. The frost trolls did not come to the loa with implorations; they came with blades. As blood flowed from their murdered god, Akali, the high prophet Gal'darah and his betrayers claimed the loa's strength as their own."
597,General Bjarngrim,"The iron forces of Loken are legion and their general, Bjarngrim, stands above them all. As the vanguard of Loken's Halls of Lightning, the iron commander ensures that any who trespass in his master's domain are terminated with extreme prejudice."
598,Volkhan,"Loken's powerful legions are a testament to the craftsmanship of his blacksmith, Volkhan. His work is never ending, ceaselessly creating soldiers to fight for the fallen keeper. Only when the blacksmith's creations stand atop the crumpled bodies of their enemies will his work be done."
599,Ionar,Loken does not rely on his iron minions as his personal defenders. The fallen keeper relies upon lightning itself. Ionar and its cohorts were given sanctuary within the Halls of Lightning in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty and willingness to slaughter any who seek to confront their new master.
600,Loken,The prime designate of Azeroth was tasked to keep Yogg-Saron secure within its prison. None could have foreseen that the keeper entrusted to safeguard the world from the Old God's malevolence would be the one responsible for its undoing.
601,Falric,This champion of the Scourge was among the first death knights created by Arthas after claiming Frostmourne. Falric loyally followed his prince on a doomed campaign to Northrend only to be rewarded with betrayal by the prince he served faithfully all his life.
602,Marwyn,"Marwyn had known Arthas all his life and saw him not just as his prince, but as a true friend. As Arthas sailed to Northrend, the knight followed him without hesitation. Though his friend would later plunge a cursed runeblade through his heart, Marwyn still felt it break upon seeing what the prince had become."
603,Escape from Arthas,"Two leaders sought to defeat the Lich King in single combat, but quickly learned they were no match against the power of the one true king. Seeking to avoid their fate, they tried to flee from his sanctum. Arthas would savor every moment of their futile efforts. There was no escape from the inevitable."
604,Krystallus,War isn't won by might alone; it is won by armies. This inherent truth inspired Loken to order the creation of loyal stone constructs to bolster his legions. Krystallus was chosen to oversee the operation and to crush any interloper that threatens its work.
605,Maiden of Grief,"Loken commands the forces of Ulduar, but not all serve him willingly. The Maiden of Grief has been ordered to destroy any who try reclaiming the Halls of Stone. She mourns turning on former allies, but fulfills her orders with violent purpose. Even her sorrows have been forged into weapons."
606,Tribunal of Ages,"Abedneum, Kaddrak, and Marnak make up the Tribunal of Ages, librarians for the titan discs that contain the ancient histories of Azeroth. The immobile constructs do not give up the titans' secrets easily, but adventurers such as the intrepid Brann Bronzebeard believe the reward is worth the risk."
607,Sjonnir the Ironshaper,"While some resisted Loken's corruption, Sjonnir the Ironshaper was eager to turn the Forge of Wills to a darker purpose. He considers his new creations vastly superior to the earthen, and will unleash them on any who defy Loken's will."
608,Forgemaster Garfrost,"Garfrost has crafted some of the most deadly weapons the Scourge has employed against the living. He can quickly forge saronite into terrible instruments of pain and death, or he can just throw it at his enemies."
609,Ick & Krick,"The diminutive necromancer Krick oversees the workers in the Pit of Saron. From atop the ghastly Ick, he can safely throw poison, explosives and dark magic at his enemies. From this vantage point, he has also learned dark secrets of Icecrown Citadel that could topple the Lich King."
610,Scourgelord Tyrannus,"The death knight Tyrannus was promoted to Scourgelord after slaying the giant Garfrost. His power, ruthlessness and frost wyrm, Rimefang, make him the perfect guardian for the Pit of Saron and the entrance to the Halls of Reflection."
611,Meathook,"Since Prince Arthas first encountered the Scourge abominations, they have become even more menacing. Meathook has grown stronger, more toxic and more agile than the others. Smarter was never the goal of the necromancers who created Meathook, but it only takes a base cunning to do what he does best."
612,Salramm the Fleshcrafter,"Salramm the Fleshcrafter was one of the first necromancers trained in the halls beneath Scholomance. He saw the test subjects, and occasional fellow students, as little more than a collection of interesting parts for his work. Now he has the entire population of Stratholme for his experiments... along with any interlopers who try to stop him."
613,Chrono-Lord Epoch,"The infinite dragonflight often tries subtle methods to manipulate the timeways, but if that fails they can send an assassin to deal with Arthas directly. While little is known about the agents of the infinite dragonflight, Epoch displays a dangerous mastery of time that makes him a deadly obstacle to Arthas's future."
614,Mal'Ganis,"The destiny of Mal'Ganis has already been written. Arthas's hatred for the dreadlord will cause the prince to travel to Northrend and take up Frostmourne. But this will only happen if Mal'Ganis finds him worthy. To prove his worthiness and begin down his path to becoming the Lich King, Arthas must survive Mal'Ganis's onslaught."
615,Bronjahm,"Bronjahm has served the Cult of the Damned from the early days. Kel'Thuzad himself taught Bronjahm the value of souls and how to grind them down to fuel the engines of the Scourge. He can corrupt the souls of his foes and tear them out piece by piece, making him the ideal guardian for the Lich King's Forge of Souls."
616,Devourer of Souls,"The dark industries Bronjahm carries out in the Forge of Souls produce tortured, fragmented spirits. To prevent their escape, and use every scrap of the damned, the Lich King created the Devourer of Souls. The Devourer of Souls hunts and consumes the stray spirits, and slowly breaks them down within its terrible form. The consumed souls are driven mad with anguish and suffering, but the Devourer's hunger is never sated."
617,Commander Stoutbeard,"Commander Stoutbeard led his troops against some of the most dangerous enemies of the Alliance. The Halls of Stasis may have slowed him down, but the sight of Horde adventurers will get him up and running again."
618,Grand Magus Telestra,"It is rumored the Grand Magus Telestra tutored Prince Kael'thas. Though she believed the Prince allying with the naga was foolish, she could not support Dalaran imprisoning her people. Malygos only needed to remind her of this betrayal to gain her as an instructor for his mage hunters."
619,Anomalus,"Directing so much of Azeroth's arcane energy through the Nexus has created tears in reality. As Malygos's forces try to drive back invading creatures, the chaotic arcane power has taken form as Anomalus. If the creature is not stopped, it will unmake everything it can touch."
620,Ormorok the Tree-Shaper,"The incredible arcane energies of the Nexus have transformed the Singing Gardens and its guardians. Ormorok's simple mind has become obsessed with the energies transforming him. For those who would interrupt his contemplations he has few words, but a mountain of violence."
621,Keristrasza,"Whether the tortures inflicted on Keristrasza were revenge for the death of Saragosa or a misguided attempt to turn her into an ally is known only to Malygos. Regardless of his intent, her allies have heard her cries of anguish and disturbing whispers of her diminishing mind."
622,Drakos the Interrogator,"Those who have broken Malygos's law may find themselves under the claws of Drakos. After securing Keristrasza in the Nexus, Drakos returned to the Oculus to collect his newer prisoners, other drakes who ran afoul of Malygos. He makes no claims of rehabilitation and he uses no metaphors. His prisoners are here to be punished, and there is no escape."
623,Varos Cloudstrider,"Varos Cloudstrider has coordinated brutal attacks against the Wyrmrest Accord since the beginning of the Nexus War. He was recalled to guard the Oculus, and he has already prepared his captains and drakes. Varos has also tapped the power coursing through the Oculus itself to bolster his defense."
624,Mage-Lord Urom,"Urom has abandoned the Kirin Tor and pledged his loyalty to Malygos, who was more than happy to receive him. The turncoat mage is an invaluable asset for the blue dragons. He knows the Kirin Tor's strengths and weaknesses. He knows how they think. And he will use that knowledge to destroy them."
625,Ley-Guardian Eregos,"Even heroes will tremble before Eregos, protector of the Oculus, defender of the ley line conduit, and executioner of interlopers. He will accomplish these tasks with the conviction of prophecy, securing the Spell-Weaver's utter dominion over all things arcane."
626,Erekem,"The Violet Hold's inmates include the most notorious of Outland's criminals, and Erekem is no exception. The Kirin Tor thwarted his plot to assassinate the Council of Six, but now the blue dragons have recruited this insidious arakkoa to achieve a more ambitious feat: wiping out every mage in Dalaran."
627,Moragg,"Cyanigosa has enlisted Moragg to help her annihilate Dalaran's renegade magi. This nightmarish demon once served the Burning Legion, eviscerating Sargeras's enemies with the baleful gaze of his seven eyes. Now he will show Azeroth's heroes that one does not simply walk into the Violet Hold..."
628,Ichoron,"A foolish apprentice summoned this revenant from the Elemental Plane, only to discover that disgruntled soldiers of the Old Gods make poor pets. Ichoron slew her would-be master and has rotted in the Violet Hold ever since, eager to wreak vengeance on her jailors."
629,Xevozz,"Xevozz was an arcane weapons dealer... until the Kirin Tor discovered he was arming the Burning Legion. Now this hardnosed ethereal is executing a three-point business plan: destroy his enemies, escape incarceration, and get back to servicing his biggest client."
630,Lavanthor,"Cyanigosa in her cold cunning has unleashed the core hound's inferno. The magi imprisoned Lavanthor to stanch the two-headed terror's thirst for blood, and years of isolation have done nothing to improve its temper."
631,Zuramat the Obliterator,"It took one hundred of Dalaran's finest to subdue Zuramat; it took twice as many to clear the carnage from the killing field. The Obliterator's malevolence gives pause even to mad Malygos, who considers the void lord's appetite for magic distasteful. But genocide makes strange bedfellows."
632,Cyanigosa,Malygos chose Cyanigosa to execute his machinations because of her unquestionable loyalty. She did not flinch when her master withdrew into madness; she did not falter when he commandeered Azeroth's ley lines; and she will not fail to eradicate all who defy him.
634,Grand Champions,"The Lich King is relentless, his undead armies pouring forth to overwhelm his foes. To prepare would-be champions against him, Highlord Tirion Fordring presents a test of courage, endurance, and teamwork. His hardened veterans will weed out those who lack the stomach to face the ravening throngs of undead."
635,Eadric the Pure,"Before heroes can challenge the forces of darkness, they must defeat agents of the Light. Highlord Tirion Fordring has selected a formidable paladin from the Argent Crusade to test combatants' mettle. Eadric will go to great lengths to cull those without the moral conviction to enter Icecrown Citadel."
636,Argent Confessor Paletress,"Before heroes can challenge the forces of darkness, they must defeat agents of the Light. Highlord Tirion Fordring has selected a formidable priest from the Argent Crusade to test combatants' mettle. Paletress will do everything in her power to ensure that only those with strong faith will confront the Scourge."
637,The Black Knight,"The Lich King is cunning and will use treachery to thwart his enemies. To that end, he has dispatched the Black Knight to eliminate promising candidates from Highlord Tirion Fordring's army. The undead's mere presence defiles the Crusaders' Coliseum, and those who prevail against him will prove their worthiness."
638,Prince Keleseth,"The Lich King deployed Keleseth to Utgarde Keep in hopes of harnessing the vrykul's potential for destruction. Upon arriving, the ambassador found a people who were more than eager to assist the Scourge. The keep has proved to be an excellent staging point for terrorizing the Howling Fjord, and Keleseth has no intention of losing it to insolent trespassers."
639,Skarvald & Dalronn,"It's a vrykul tradition to make unlikely partners work together. Some say it's to allow divergent abilities to complement each other; others say it's for the amusement of King Ymiron. Regardless, Skarvald and Dalronn are a perfect example of this custom. Between a vrykul's brawn and a human's necromantic arts, they will punish those who meddle with the Scourge."
640,Ingvar the Plunderer,"Ingvar's brute strength is legendary even among the vrykul. Rumor has it that he once bested King Ymiron in a brawl. The truth is unknown, but purveyors of that tale usually don't live for a retelling. Ingvar has promised the Lich King that he'll use all measures of brutality to hold the keep, a promise that he dare not break."
641,Svala Sorrowgrave,"Svala distinguished herself as Ingvar the Plunderer's lieutenant, leading perilous scouting missions in Horde and Alliance outposts. It was she who discovered the enemy's plans to invade Utgarde, giving the Lich King time to prepare. For her service, he has transformed her into a val'kyr, revered warrior maiden of the Scourge."
642,Gortok Palehoof,"The vrykul keep many trophies at Utgarde Keep, and Gortok is among the most impressive. King Ymiron displays the frozen magnataur's cruel countenance as a reminder that even the most savage beasts are mere decorations for vrykul halls. This living statue will sow destruction if liberated, unleashing his wrath indiscriminately."
643,Skadi the Ruthless,"The vrykul assign nicknames based on accomplishments. Cleansing a Drakkari bloodline or decapitating taunka might garner the appellation of ""dutiful,"" but it takes a true act of depravity to be called ""ruthless."" Skadi earned his title long ago for relentlessly hunting down vrykul who sheltered the malformed infants, predecessors of humanity, condemned by Ymiron."
644,King Ymiron,"Proud Ymiron ruled the northern wastes until the vrykul's long slumber relegated him to insignificance. He regained consciousness to find that his wife had been murdered, his lands besieged by enemies. He has cast off his mortality and demands vengeance, eager to show the terrible resolve of an awakened giant."
649,Raigonn,"This colossal mantid spearheads the assault against the gates. Acting as a living battering ram, Raigonn mercilessly hammers the pandaren defenses, seeking to decimate any and all obstacles barring the mantid's ruthless invasion of Pandaria."
654,Armsmaster Harlan,"The weapons of the Scarlet Crusade are many, and new initiates must be indoctrinated in the use of blade, hammer, arrow, and shield--effective tools against the undead. Armsmaster Harlan has dedicated his life to the art of wielding these indelicate instruments, and he is pleased to provide a demonstration for the Crusade's blasphemous enemies."
655,Saboteur Kip'tilak,"The mantid are no strangers to warfare, using technology to turn the tide of battle. The pandaren stand little chance against munitions experts such as Kip'tilak, who strike deep behind enemy lines and threaten to destroy the already weakening fortifications from within."
656,Flameweaver Koegler,"Flameweaver Koegler trains the Scarlet Crusade's more magically minded adepts in the subtle applications of the arcane. Fire is his specialty, and he has used his skills to burn the order's historical tomes, erasing the Crusade's past failures. Apart from books, Koegler's flames have rendered many--undead, students, and trespassers alike--into piles of smoking ash."
657,Master Snowdrift,"Master Snowdrift recognizes that the battles between the Horde and the Alliance have contributed to the monastery's dire state. Heroes seeking this wary pandaren's loyalty must first best his students. Only those who prevail can face Snowdrift himself, a paragon of martial arts who has dedicated his life to attaining perfection of body and mind."
658,Liu Flameheart,"Since she was a cub, the priestess Liu Flameheart has studied the cycle of rebirth for the Jade Serpent, Yu'lon. When the Sha of Doubt attacked, Liu was the first to resist, but she was also the first to succumb to corruption. Now she is consumed with uncertainty, fearing she may not have the strength to ensure Yu'lon's rebirth."
659,Instructor Chillheart,"Course: Introduction to the Dark Arts

Instructor Chillheart journeyed from Northrend to teach aspiring necromancers discipline, harshly punishing those who disappoint her. She commands the icy chill of the north and masterfully uses Scholomance's libraries to deadly effect."
660,Houndmaster Braun,"The quickest and surest way to detect the undead is by the scent of rot they carry, and even the most veteran soldier cannot match the olfactory sense of a hound. Houndmaster Braun has bred and trained a savage pack of canines to aid the crusaders in hunting down their foes--living and undead."
663,Jandice Barov,"Course: Advanced Illusions

Barov's spirit lurked in the recesses of Scholomance for years, but now she has taken a more active role in educating the next generation of magi. Her vast knowledge of illusions has made her both a valued educator and a dangerous opponent to anyone foolish enough to draw her ire."
664,Lorewalker Stonestep,"The Sha of Doubt's minions gleefully invaded the Temple of the Jade Serpent's library, creating twisted, destructive versions of heroes and other characters of pandaren lore. Despite his best efforts, Lorewalker Stonestep has been unable to restore these manifestations of the past to their uncorrupted forms."
665,Rattlegore,"Course: Reanimation 101

Rattlegore was thought to have been destroyed in Andorhal, but Gandling immediately began preparations to reanimate the clattering terror so he could guard against intruders. The Darkmaster sought to make Rattlegore more ferocious than ever, imbuing him with an insatiable desire to harvest raw materials from his enemies."
666,Lilian Voss,"Course: Reeducation

The undead Lilian Voss strangled her father--a high priest of the Scarlet Crusade--for treachery, and then started a rampage that eventually led her into the shadowy corridors of Scholomance. Rather than destroy the intruder, Darkmaster Gandling graciously decided to show Voss how to embrace her grim fate. The anger and runeblades she had once directed at the school are now turned toward Gandling's enemies."
668,Ook-Ook,"Even for a hozen, Ook-Ook has a reputation for being uncouth and raucous. The monstrous creature and his cronies recently broke into the Stormstout Brewery and cracked open its precious beer casks to throw the greatest party of all time: Ookapalooza!"
669,Hoptallus,Hoptallus is the bane of farmers throughout the Valley of the Four Winds - a virmen of mythic proportions that can consume entire fields of crops in a single night. Word has spread that the giant pest and his offspring have infested the brewery and begun devouring its stores of rice and barley.
670,Yan-Zhu the Uncasked,"In a desperate attempt to save the family brewery, Uncle Gao set about concocting what he believed would be the ultimate ale, a full-bodied elixir of depthless flavor. Yet his bold experiment resulted in a bitter and extremely volatile alemental creature, dubbed Yan-Zhu the Uncasked."
671,Brother Korloff,"Brother Korloff first learned of the monk's deadly arts from pandaren ambassadors as they journeyed through Azeroth. When the crusader demonstrated this martial style to his superiors, they unanimously ordered Korloff to train an entire generation of initiates in the ways of the monk."
672,Wise Mari,"The revered jinyu waterspeaker Wise Mari has found knowledge and foresight countless times in the Fountain of the Everseeing. But when the Sha of Doubt corrupted the familiar currents, Mari was overwhelmed with limitless distrust and suspicion."
673,Gu Cloudstrike,"Before the escape of the sha, Gu Cloudstrike was entrusted with training the elite Shado-Pan spellcasters. Now this formerly gentle and reserved pandaren revels in unleashing his astounding powers, with devastating consequences. He has asserted control over the mystical Azure Serpent, and his students are helpless in the wake of Cloudstrike's lethal attacks."
674,High Inquisitor Whitemane,"At a young age, Sally Whitemane witnessed her family succumb to the horrific plague of undeath as they were traveling through northern Lordaeron. She was then forced to destroy her parents and siblings when they rose as mindless Scourge minions, leaving her racked by guilt and rage. Ever since that day, the fearsome priestess has found fulfillment and pleasure in only one thing: the destruction of undead."
675,Striker Ga'dok,"The strikers are an aerial component of the mantid empire's massive army. Among them are seasoned aces such as Ga'dok. Able to singlehandedly rain fiery devastation upon scores of enemies, Ga'dok and his minions seek to bring death from above to the gates' defenders."
676,Commander Ri'mok,"Commander Ri'mok oversees the mantid ground forces relentlessly besieging the towering gates. Unimpressed by the defenders, Ri'mok calls upon countless reinforcements to vanquish those foolish enough to stand in his way."
677,Will of the Emperor,"The core chamber of the vaults houses an army of stone soldiers who have been motionless for centuries. They are row upon row of warriors, statues armed for a battle that never began. What treasures do they guard? And what is their tie to the titanic power buried with them here in the shadows?"
679,The Stone Guard,"The first line of defense against those daring to enter the vaults is a stolid row of enchanted, bestial statues. Hard as granite and ceaseless in their vigil, the sentries of the Stone Guard present an insurmountable wall of flame, fangs, and claws."
682,Gara'jal the Spiritbinder,"Leader of the Zandalar trolls' assault on the vaults, Gara'jal is determined to crack open this trove of ancient mystery and bring back whatever arcane power and knowledge he can find. Gifted with dark talents and surrounded by a loyal cadre of Zandalar mystics, he has broken through the outer walls and will not rest until the vaults belong to him."
683,Protectors of the Endless,"When the Sha of Fear invaded the Terrace of Endless Spring, three venerated jinyu protectors were corrupted, and they betrayed the other mortal sentinels, slaying them all. The twisted guardians have now turned their attention to any intruders who might interrupt the sha's  attack on the area's last defenses."
684,Darkmaster Gandling,"Course: Advanced Studies

The recent defeat in Andorhal has put Darkmaster Gandling in the foulest of moods. More than ever, all students of Scholomance are advised to impress him at every turn. Pupils who dissatisfy the headmaster will be removed from class to perform lab work... or become lab work."
685,Sha of Violence,"Bloodthirsty, ruthless, and savage, the Sha of Violence is unfettered within the Shado-Pan Monastery. Feeding on the Horde and Alliance's brutality, the entity gleefully ravages the monks who struggle to impede the monstrous onslaught."
686,Taran Zhu,"The Sha of Hatred has tainted Taran Zhu, the Shado-Pan's pragmatic and mighty leader. Once devoted to protecting his beloved home, Zhu now burns with seething hatred for all life, twisting his perception of everything--and everyone--around him."
687,The Spirit Kings,"Ancient records tell of these legendary rulers, powerful mogu who carved an empire from the very rock of Pandaria. Their names still cause the land to tremble: Zian of the Endless Shadow, Meng the Demented, Qiang the Merciless, and Subetai the Swift. Some say their spirits lurk in the vaults, lost in ghostly memories of battle and glory."
688,Thalnos the Soulrender,"Thalnos earned repute in the Scarlet Crusade for the brutal torture methods he used to ""purify"" new recruits. Ultimately, the sadistic mage contracted the plague of undeath and arose as a fearsome skeletal being. The vengeful Thalnos now prowls the monastery's graveyard, commanding apparitions and zombified creatures to attack anyone who trespasses on his unholy domain."
689,Feng the Accursed,"Long ago, Feng Shri was the Mogu'shan Vaults' caretaker, tasked with preserving the treasures kept within these shadowy halls. After years of faithful service, he was caught stealing from the shelves (although some say he was framed by a jealous underling) and the mogu ruler punished him with a fatal curse. The doomed spirit of Feng Shri has wandered the vaults ever since, communing with the shades of past mogu heroes and warlords."
690,Gekkan,"As the mogu clans battle for supremacy, the cunning Gekkan leads his fearsome saurok raiding party into the palace's fabled treasure caches. Loyalty is not usually ascribed to these ruthless reptilian beings, but Gekkan's courage and tactical brilliance inspire a sense of honor in his soldiers."
691,Sha of Anger,"The Sha of Anger, the physical manifestation of rage, has escaped from the Shado-pan Monastery in Kun-Lai Summit. Amid the brutal conflicts gripping Pandaria, the dark entity has grown ever more powerful. Recently, the sha has been seen wandering Kun-Lai, using negative energies to corrupt everything the being encounters."
692,General Pa'valak,"The pragmatic General Pa'valak does not fear the pandaren or their allies, and he does not differentiate between using his own might and that of his mantid armies to defeat his enemies. Victory is the only honor he seeks, and Pa'valak will not tolerate failure should his minions fall short of their goal."
693,Vizier Jin'bak,"Vizier Jin'bak roams just beyond the mantid's natural bridge, collecting the tree root's precious sap. Using his vast alchemical knowledge, this formidable being is transforming the substance into weapons and other tools that will help advance the siege on Niuzao Temple."
694,Adarogg,Ragefire Chasm's trogg population has rapidly declined in recent months for one reason: Adarogg. This ravenous flame hound was among the first of his kind ripped from the Firelands by dark shaman. Adarogg's handlers feed the unruly beast over twice his weight in trogg flesh per day to keep him appeased.
695,Dark Shaman Koranthal,"Koranthal has always believed that brute force is the only way to control Azeroth's elementals. His extreme views led him to join the ranks of the sinister Twilight's Hammer. When the cult fell, the orc and other like-minded shaman secretly infiltrated Ragefire Chasm to continue practicing their dark arts."
696,Slagmaw,"Unlike other lava worms enslaved by the dark shaman, Slagmaw has proven to be nearly impossible to control. The beast lives to dig through the depths of the earth, and it cares nothing for the consequences of its actions, or the damage it causes to anyone who stands in its way."
697,Lava Guard Gordoth,"Hubris drove the brilliant shaman Gordoth to act as a living conduit for energies pulled from the Firelands. He and his allies had hoped to mimic the creation of elemental ascendants in the Twilight's Hammer cult. Instead, the explosive influx of power drove Gordoth insane and mutated his body into a hideous form."
698,Xin the Weaponmaster,"The title of weaponmaster has many definitions among Azeroth's inhabitants. To Xin, it means that mogu weaponry obeys his every command. The king is more than willing to demonstrate his deadly skills to anyone who questions his right to rule Pandaria."
708,Trial of the King,"Ming the Cunning, Kuai the Brute, and Haiyan the Unstoppable have journeyed to the palace with their clans, vying to prove their worth to their king. Yet these mogu factions are plagued with bitter rivalries. Violence threatens to flood the palatial grounds unless the bickering clans can find a way to test their strength without coming to blows with one another."
709,Sha of Fear,"The Sha of Fear is the physical manifestation of terror in Pandaria. Imprisoned by the legendary pandaren emperor Shaohao long ago, the entity has been newly strengthened by rising conflict across the island."
713,Garalon,It may be time to reconsider stepping on bugs. Don't make fun of this hulking behemoth's tiny wings; that'll just make him angry.
725,Salyis's Warband,"The ruthless saurok roam Pandaria, stealing what they can and harassing the island's other inhabitants. The most infamous of these reptilian pillagers are Chief Salyis and his warband. For years, the saurok commander and his raiders have stormed through the Valley of the Four Winds atop Galleon, a colossal and well-armed mushan that is more a moving fortress than a simple mount."
726,Elegon,"Dedicated to the advancement of their empire, the mogu salvaged and repurposed titan technology to generate untold power in the depths of this ancient complex. Why these energies have been focused into the cold will of a celestial dragon is a mystery that lies at the very heart of the vaults."
727,Wing Leader Ner'onok,"Wing Leader Ner'onok's decisive blows have won a hundred battles. The small gains General Pa'valak has made are nothing compared to the victory Ner'onok believes he could achieve if he were in command. Although his aerial attacks have thus far devastated the temple's guardians, the winged terror still longs for a chance to prove his superiority over the general."
728,Blood Guard Porung,"During the bloody siege of Shattrath, Porung stormed an enclave of draenei paladins who had barricaded themselves within a corner of the city. He single-handedly slaughtered the defenders, but suffered a grave injury that left him incapable of following the Horde when it later stormed Azeroth. Now recovered, Porung serves Warchief Kargath Bladefist in Hellfire Citadel, hoping to make up for the glorious battles he has missed and write his name in orcish history with the blood of his enemies."
729,Lei Shi,"For countless years, this friendly water spirit frolicked in the Fountains of Endless Spring with childlike wonder and glee. When fighting suddenly broke out in this peaceful place, Lei Shi saw the crystal-clear water turn cloudy and murky, and terror fell over her mind."
737,Amber-Shaper Un'sok,"Eager to please his empress, Un'sok has produced several innovative concoctions. Yet this brilliant young alchemist's proximity to the mantid queen has allowed the sha's negative energies to take root in his mind. Now, Un'sok's overwhelming fear of failure drives him to create increasingly deadlier weapons."
738,Commander Vo'jak,"What Commander Vo'jak lacks in strategic brilliance, he makes up for with raw ferocity. His devastating strikes were crucial to the mantid's exploitation of their insidious bridge, allowing them to infiltrate the island. Yet devising battle plans is for the mantid general; Vo'jak craves only blood."
741,Wind Lord Mel'jarak,"Wind Lord Mel'jarak commands the mantid's numerous aerial forces. Although he exudes arrogance, the cunning insectoid is fiercely protective of his soldiers and enjoys fighting at their side. Mel'jarak believes the mantid are superior to all other races, convinced that his kind cannot be defeated."
742,Tsulong,"Legends speak of a spiraling, golden serpent that can sometimes be seen high in the sky, basking in the sunlight above the clouds. The few who claim to have observed it themselves say the creature is fiercely protective of the terrace."
743,Grand Empress Shek'zeer,"The ancient Klaxxi order has come to a mournful decision: the tainted grand empress Shek'zeer must be deposed. Traditionally, mantid rulers are displaced in their old age by a carefully chosen successor. However, Shek'zeer's intended replacement is still too young and weak to unseat her, leaving the Klaxxi with no choice but to kill the current empress. If action is not taken against her soon, all of Pandaria may crumble before the mantid's ravenous swarms."
744,Blade Lord Ta'yak,"Ta'yak is known for his patience and intelligence. In battle, he is a master at discovering his opponent's weaknesses and awaiting the perfect opportunity to strike. Ta'yak's skill with a blade is unmatched, and he cherishes imparting his martial knowledge on young mantid warriors."
745,Imperial Vizier Zor'lok,"Zor'lok shrieks his proclamations so they're heard throughout the sprawling mantid palace. He is the Voice of the Empress, and his words alone inspire the insectoid race's warriors to give their lives without question. Unwaveringly loyal, Zor'lok will stop at nothing to defend his beloved matriarch, regardless of the corruption within her."
748,Obsidian Sentinel,"The Obsidian Sentinel was responsible for guarding Uldaman's secrets until it was corrupted by an unknown force. Originally crafted from the same stone as the halls of Uldaman itself, this keeper has had the majority of its body replaced with dark glass capable of reflecting spells. Whatever was responsible for the Obsidian Sentinel's transformation must be incredibly potent, for it is not easy to alter the enchanted stone of a titan construct."
749,Commander Malor,"Malor and a handful of other courageous warriors risked everything to protect the Scarlet Bastion from being desecrated by the undead. Tragically, they failed. Balnazzar corrupted the fearless commander into one of his servants, transforming the zealot into a mockery of his former self."
814,"Nalak, The Storm Lord","When Lei Shen discovered a rare clutch of thundering cloud serpents, he was awed, and set to subjugating them. The largest hatchling fiercely resisted, and when Lei Shen visited the handling pens, he laughed mightily at the charred mogu that lined the walls. He took the hatchling for his own, and for its obedience, granted it power over the storms and the sky.  For thousands of years following the death of the Thunder King, Nalak has guarded the walls of his hidden citadel, awaiting his return."
816,Council of Elders,"The history of the troll tribes -- the Drakkari, the Farraki, the Amani, and the Gurubashi -- is awash with millennia of betrayal and conflict, but the Zandalari's promise of a new, unstoppable empire has finally united these disparate troll leaders."
817,Iron Qon,"Legends speak of the brutality of Qon and his quilen champions. The fearless mogu commander was dubbed ""Iron Qon"" by the Thunder King for his unrelenting resolve to claim victory after victory for the empire regardless of the cost."
818,Durumu the Forgotten,"Lei Shen commanded his sorcerers to mold an aberration that could peer into the hearts of his followers and detect betrayal. From this decree, Durumu was given life. The clever entity stubbornly obeyed its masters until the Thunder King's death, at which time it disappeared into the citadel's labyrinthine corridors. Only recently has Durumu, all but forgotten by the mogu, emerged from hiding."
819,Horridon,"The Zandalari brought powerful creatures with them to the Isle of the Thunder King to use as engines of war. Led by the War-God Jalak, the dinomancers of the Zandalari Beast Ward use ancient tribal magics to strengthen the great beasts and command obedience. The horns of Horridon, the fabled mount of Jalak himself, can tear through the stone walls of a keep as a blade cuts silk."
820,Primordius,"Deep within the bowels of Lei Shen's island citadel, mogu flesh-shapers formed the saurok out of a magical substance of unknown origin. When the citadel was abandoned, some experiments languished in the dark pools for far too long...."
821,Megaera,"Even the most callous among the mogu quaver at the thought of the dark experiments performed at the Thunder King's behest. Long ago, a young cloud serpent was twisted into a multi-headed hydra and left to languish beneath Lei Shen's throne. Now the twisted creature lurks deep in the Forgotten Depths, awaiting the moment it may finally inflict its terrible agony upon others."
824,Dark Animus,"During his reign, Lei Shen labored to build a mechanical servant that would defend his citadel without fear. When his first attempt failed, rage took hold of the Thunder King. He poured this negative emotion into his next, and most successful, creation: the Dark Animus. To this day, the ornate construct observes its duty, empowered by the mysterious substance at the heart of all mogu flesh-shaping experiments."
825,Tortos,"Over the millennia, small amounts of mogu flesh-shaping magic seeped into the caverns below the Thunder King's citadel. The dark energies warped one of the chamber's native dragon turtles, melding it to the surrounding crystalline walls. Known as Tortos, this amalgamation of flesh and stone has since feasted on the cave's rich mineral deposits and grown to a colossal size."
826,Oondasta,"As the war against Lei Shen's island citadel began, Alliance and Horde scouts made an effort to intercept missives between the major Zandalari camps. One such exchange seemed to revolve around an unfamiliar Zandalari word, always surrounded by terms of conquest and power: Oondasta. Somewhere in Pandaria, the Zandalari Beast Ward raises their mighty beasts as engines of war, and is putting the finishing touches on this Loa-infused monstrosity. The exact location, however, remains unknown..."
827,Jin'rokh the Breaker,"When the Thunder King awoke, he rewarded the most loyal and ambitious Zandalari trolls with power beyond their wildest dreams. The berserker Jin'rokh was one of the first to receive the King's blessing, and even though Lei Shen's gifts nearly tore his body apart, the troll is now capable of calling the fury of the storm in battle."
828,Ji-Kun,"Mogu flesh-shapers discarded their failed creations in an abyssal shaft beneath Lei Shen's keep. The reek of decay lured many scavengers to the refuse pit, including the great Ji-Kun. Ruthless and cunning, the monstrous bird devoured her rivals one-by-one until she held sole dominion over the shadowy tunnel."
829,Twin Empyreans,"The Twin Empyreans are among the most formidable of the Thunder King's champions. Determined to safeguard his reign, Lei Shen keeps his loyalists close and their combined arsenal against interlopers closer."
831,Ra-den,"Lei Shen's life changed forever when he stumbled into a dark chamber below what are now the Mogu'shan Vaults. Legend has it he found an ancient titan keeper guarding a miraculous device known as the Engine of Nalak'sha. No one knows what transpired between the two beings, but Lei Shen later emerged from the site bristling with the power to forge an empire. The keeper's fate -- and his current whereabouts -- remain a mystery."
832,Lei Shen,"Tyrant. Dictator. Conqueror. Emperor. These titles of the Thunder King were earned by bringing absolute misery to every race of Pandaria. Resurrected into a world where his people no longer rule, Lei Shen is bent on ending the farce and bringing the land under his heel once more."
833,Commander Kolurg,Commander Kolurg sought dangerous treasures to add to the Horde armories. His anger at his misfortune in the Halls of Stasis will not be eased when he thaws to find Alliance adventurers stealing his thunder.
834,Grand Champions,"The Lich King is relentless, his undead armies pouring forth to overwhelm his foes. To prepare would-be champions against him, Highlord Tirion Fordring presents a test of courage, endurance, and teamwork. His hardened veterans will weed out those who lack the stomach to face the ravening throngs of undead."
846,Malkorok,"Malkorok has been Garrosh's most loyal and trusted lieutenant throughout the Pandaria campaign. When the Warchief needed a volunteer to infuse with the power of Y'Shaarj, it was only natural that Malkorok would offer without hesitation."
849,The Fallen Protectors,"The Golden Lotus and Shado-Pan guardians of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms were caught in the epicenter of the devastating blast that scarred the Vale, and torn apart by the dark energies. Their spirits linger in the place they once protected, confused and tormented by their failure."
850,General Nazgrim,"Once a grunt in service of the former warchief, Thrall, General Nazgrim rose quickly through the ranks after overwhelming victories in Grizzly Hills and the sunken city of Vashj'ir. Fiercely loyal to the Horde and bound by a rigorous code of honor and duty, Nazgrim will hold the line for his warchief until his dying breath."
851,Thok the Bloodthirsty,"When the Isle of Giants was discovered off the coast of Pandaria, teeming with primal devilsaurs, Garrosh sent troops to capture some of the most fearsome specimens, hoping to subjugate them and use them as beasts of war. Countless orcish beastmasters have fallen to Thok's jaws as they struggle to tame him, yet the creature's thirst for blood remains unslaked."
852,Immerseus,"The ancient inhabitants of Pandaria recognized the vital importance of the lifegiving Pools of Power, building an underground system of aqueducts to safeguard the waters and nurture life in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. The touch of corruption has animated and twisted these waters, and Immerseus stands as an unnatural embodiment of the Vale's sorrow."
853,Paragons of the Klaxxi,"The nine surviving Klaxxi'va Paragons are ancient champions of the mantid who fought alongside the Wakener against the madness of Empress Shek'zeer. But the paragons, as do all mantid, hold a far deeper loyalty. When Garrosh unearthed the heart of Y'Shaarj, the paragons followed the whispers of their ancient master to the iron halls beneath Orgrimmar."
856,Kor'kron Dark Shaman,"Haromm and Kardris trained thousands of shaman to whisper reverently to the elements to requisition their aid. The army of Garrosh, however, does not ask - they take what they desire in the name of the True Horde. Dark Shamanism forces the elements into servitude, twisting them into burned-out ash, corrupted waters, and toxic air."
857,"Chi-Ji, The Red Crane","The trial of Chi-Ji is a test of hope. Uncertain of the future of his people, Emperor Shaohao sought out the great Red Crane. The Great Crane challenged Shaohao to find the hope within himself, and cast off his uncertainty. Once the Sha of Doubt was vanquished, the Emperor became a beacon of hope for his people. To pass the trial of the Crane, warriors must believe in hope, even in the darkest of days."
858,"Yu'lon, The Jade Serpent","The trial of Yu'lon is a test of wisdom and faith. With omens of a bleak future floating through his mind, Emperor Shaohao climbed to the summit of Mount Neverest to seek the council of the Jade Serpent. Yu'lon urged Shaohao to cast off the dark emotions that plagued him, and through his trials, Emperor Shaohao would become one with the land. To pass the trial of the Serpent, warriors must be wise in their choices."
859,"Niuzao, The Black Ox","The trial of Niuzao is a test of bravery and fortitude.  When Emperor Shaohao was overcome with fear, the Black Ox counseled him to face his fears directly. After a protracted battle with the Sha of Fear, the Emperor emerged victorious. To pass the trial of the Ox, warriors must be resolute in the face of overwhelming danger."
860,"Xuen, The White Tiger","The trial of Xuen is simultaneously a test of strength and a test of restraint. When Xuen gave Emperor Shaohao a 10-foot-pole and asked him to strike one of Xuen's warriors, the Emperor could not land a blow. For without restraint, anger and hatred run wild. To pass the trial of the Tiger, warriors must harness their power, while burying their thoughts of violence."
861,"Ordos, Fire-God of the Yaungol","Ordos was once a shaman of the Yaungol who sacrificed himself to the flame, following the promises of the Fire Lords, in order to become a demigod. His flesh is eternally seared with fires, putting him in endless agony. Yaungol Fire-Keepers ritualistically set themselves ablaze to emulate the ascension of Ordos, and cast enchantments and prayers to ease his pain."
864,Iron Juggernaut,"This mechanical terror, designed nearly as much for intimidation as destruction, is the centerpiece of Garrosh's siege weaponry. Crafted in the image of the mighty Kor'kron war scorpion, the Iron Juggernaut guards the gates of Orgrimmar, crushing any who would rise up to challenge Garrosh's True Horde."
865,Siegecrafter Blackfuse,"Helix Blackfuse was the only goblin with the combination of engineering prowess, professionalism, and ruthlessness to satisfy Garrosh in his search for the engineer of the True Horde. A mercenary at heart, Blackfuse's love for his creations (and the gold they fetch) has forever linked his fate with that of his patron and Warchief."
866,Norushen,"Some say that the mogu race was created in the image of this titanic construct, left deep beneath Pandaria to watch over and guard the continent's darkest and most dangerous secret."
867,Sha of Pride,"The seventh sha, the Sha of Pride, was the final burden to which Emperor Shaohao clung, shrouding the land in mist and biding its time for millennia. When Garrosh awakened the Heart of Y'Shaarj, the force of his arrogance caused this dark energy to coalesce in the chamber where the Heart was unearthed."
868,Galakras,"Warlord Zaela formed a close bond with Garrosh during events in the Twilight Highlands, and she and her Dragonmaw orcs have pledged loyalty to Garrosh's cause. Riding atop the fearsome Galakras, a direct descendant of the cataclysmic progenitor of all dragonkind, Zaela oversees the naval defense of Orgrimmar."
869,Garrosh Hellscream,"Garrosh, son of Grommash Hellscream, first learned of his father's heroism when Thrall encountered the young orc in Outland. The seeds of pride were planted. Garrosh spearheaded Horde victories in Northrend and, as Warchief, consolidated Horde power amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm. But his visions of orc supremacy by any means have brought the armies of the world crashing down upon Orgrimmar... a final reckoning that Garrosh himself awaits with brutal relish."
870,Spoils of Pandaria,"When Garrosh gazed across Pandaria, he saw untapped power. During the course of his campaign, Garrosh has plundered weapons, treasures, and artifacts of the pandaren, the mogu, and the mantid. They are kept in a warehouse deep within his underground base, guarded by a mysterious security system that appears to be of Titan origins."
881,Galakras,"Warlord Zaela formed a close bond with Garrosh during events in the Twilight Highlands, and she and her Dragonmaw orcs have pledged loyalty to Garrosh's cause. Riding atop the fearsome Galakras, a direct descendant of the cataclysmic progenitor of all dragonkind, Zaela oversees the naval defense of Orgrimmar."
887,Roltall,"Roltall is a fearsome elemental conjured by Gug'rokk himself and tethered to the threshold of Gug'rokk's chambers as a final bit of insurance in case of a slave revolt. The fiery creature keeps eternal vigil in its appointed place, calling down molten rock to repel any intruders."
888,Slave Watcher Crushto,"This cruel ogre taskmaster oversees the mining operation within the sweltering pits beneath Frostfire Ridge. Slaves from across Draenor are delivered to Crushto's care, who views them as expendable and will not hesitate to bludgeon them into submission (or worse) if they step out of line."
889,Gug'rokk,"Born in the capital of Highmaul, Gug'rokk was at first disdainful of his assignment as the governor of the Bloodmaul mines deep within Frostfire. Over time, however, he has come to appreciate the merits of operating on the outskirts of the Gorian Empire, with absolute control and minimal oversight."
893,Magmolatus,"The ogre geomancers of Frostfire pride themselves on harnessing the elements, but sometimes they overreach. Gog'duh has stoked the flames of his forge to new heights, driving Magmolatus into such a fury that it requires Gog'duh's full concentration to keep the raging slag elemental under control."
895,Roogug,"Quilboar society regards the reading of stones and crystals as the highest form of shamanism. Roogug served the Quilboar people for many years, quietly honing his divinative arts. He now serves the Quilboar as the overseer of all geomancers and has amassed a powerful array of crystals with which to dispose of weaker foes. It is only a matter of time before these mystics overrun the Southern Barrens."
896,Hunter Bonetusk,"If a hunter's accomplishments are measured by the trophies they return with, Bonetusk would be regarded as one of the best. His cunning aim and animalistic instincts brought his hunting and tracking abilities to new heights, and only the strong stand a chance to survive against this veteran hunter."
899,Warlord Ramtusk,"The commander of the Razorfen military forces, Warlord Ramtusk is a massive aging Quilboar whose thick hide bears the scars of many battles with centaur, harpies, orcs, and even tauren. In his later years, Ramtusk has embraced the company of Quilboar spirit leaders; Aggem Thorncurse and Death Speaker Jargba guide his thoughts from the spirit realm."
900,"Groyat, the Blind Hunter","After years of seclusion, a monstrous creature from deep inside the dark grotto emerged. This gargantuan bat continually feeds on the boar once named Agathelos the Raging, whose dark power was once fueled by continual consumption of bat guano."
901,Charlga Razorflank,"The leader (or ""crone"") of the Razorfen tribes is Charlga Razorflank, a quilboar whose experimental and powerful Geomancy practices are second to none. Her meteoric rise to power and the rapidly increasing violence between quilboar tribesmen can only lead to one thing: war."
959,Blackhand,"A ruthless tyrant and fierce warrior, Blackhand is Warlord of the Blackrock clan, second only to Grommash in stature within the Iron Horde. Bathed in sweltering heat that few other mortals could withstand,  Blackhand oversees the operations of his Foundry from atop its Crucible, wielding his smoldering slag hammer to forge weapons of peerless quality."
965,Ranjit,"Ranjit has spent a lifetime honing his skill with the bladed chakram, and found that as his mastery of the traditional arakkoa weapon grew, he could shape the wind itself and wield it against his enemies. He now guards access to the inner sanctum of Skyreach, willing to die to protect the seat of arakkoa power atop the Spires."
966,Araknath,"The high arakkoa of Skyreach closely observed the civilization of the draenei, taking a keen interest in the towering Vigilants that guard their cities and temples. The arakkoa set out to create their own superior version, powered by solar energy - an unwaveringly obedient engine of destruction."
967,Rukhran,"This majestic bird, rumored to be the progeny of the arakkoa sun-god Rukhmar, soars through the skies above the Spires of Arak. Rukhran has an affinity for solar energy, and can absorb the sun's power and unleash it to incinerate any prey."
968,High Sage Viryx,"High Sage Viryx has dedicated her rule wholly to harnessing Apexis artifacts in service of Rukhmar's will. At last, thanks to the completion of the massive crystal superweapon that focuses the sun's energy to destroy their enemies, it is time for the arakkoa to claim their rightful place as rulers of Draenor."
971,The Butcher,"Born in the fetid Underbelly of Highmaul, this ogre may have once had a proper name, but it is long forgotten. Abused and beaten from his earliest days, the hardship only strengthened his body even as it broke his mind. Now there is not an ogre in Highmaul who will not give him a wide berth as he hacks away at slaughtered carcasses to pass his days."
1122,Beastlord Darmac,"As a young orc, Darmac quickly rose through the ranks of the Thunderlord as a gifted trainer of beasts. Where others only saw animal instincts, he recognized intellect and drew forth untapped potential from brain and muscle and bone. When the Iron Horde demanded his service, Darmac saw no greater honor than to outfit and train the most savage beasts Draenor had to offer."
1123,Flamebender Ka'graz,"Under the banner of the Iron Horde, Blackhand has enlisted Flamebender Ka'graz of the Burning Blade to imbue the Blackrock-forged armaments with the essence of flame. Along with her assistant Aknor Steelbringer, Ka'graz toils before an everburning forge in support of the Iron Horde's conquest of Draenor."
1128,Kargath Bladefist,"Kargath Bladefist, Warlord of the Shattered Hand, honed his brutal skills as a slave in the ogres' gladiatorial games. He slaughtered countless opponents for the promise of freedom, but after winning, was locked away with the other retired ""champions."" Fueled by rage, Kargath tore off his own hand to escape and led a revolt that soaked Draenor in ogre blood. Now, he returns to the arena to teach you the true meaning of savagery."
1133,Skylord Tovra,"Before the rise of the Iron Horde, Tovra had never ventured beyond the frigid tundra of Frostfire, where she led groups of Thunderlord trackers to snare and capture the fiercest rylaks on Draenor. Her mastery of rylaks has made Tovra an invaluable asset, and she now commands the aerial forces of the Iron Horde."
1138,Rocketspark and Borka,"Railmaster Pauli Rocketspark, chief foreman of the Grimrail Depot, has been enlisted by Garrosh Hellscream to build the technology required for the Iron Horde's infrastructure. Given the dim-witted assistant Borka to do the heavy lifting, Rocketspark set about building the Grimrail."
1139,Sadana Bloodfury,"Sadana Bloodfury is a powerful acolyte of the Shadowmoon clan, deeply connected to the lunar cycles. When the whispers of the dark star worked their way into the hearts of the Shadowmoon, Sadana followed her chieftain Ner'zhul into their clan's burial grounds, using her powers to lure the spirits of the dead for a twisted purpose."
1140,Bonemaw,"Deep within the subterranean caverns under Shadowmoon Valley, the carrion worm Bonemaw has a symbiotic relationship with Ner'zhul's followers: The creature feasts upon the dead left in the wake of the Shadowmoon cult's dark rituals, and in return it serves as a formidable guardian of Ner'zhul's inner sanctum."
1141,Amnennar the Coldbringer,"The lich Amnennar was once a force of reckoning within the Scourge, participating in the assault on Mount Hyjal during the Third War. Afterward, the Lich King instructed his servant to remain in Kalimdor and expand the Scourge's influence. This effort was thwarted by heroes of the Horde and Alliance, however. Now the relative peace that has been brought to Razorfen Downs may be threatened. Death Speaker Blackthorn hopes to revive this powerful lich and renew the assault on the Barrens."
1142,Aarux,The Arachnomancers of the Death's Head cult are particularly proud of their efforts.  After many failed attempts they have finally created a suitable guardian for Death Speaker Blackthorn.  Aarux is a huge spider whose body bristles with toxin filled pustules that burst and ooze noxious liquids.  The Arachnomancers now await the opportune moment to unleash their creation.
1143,Mushlump,"A recent creation of Death Speaker Blackthorn, Mushlump is a grotesque collection of parts collected from other failed creations.  Full of bile, pus, and other noxious humors, Mushlump contaminates the halls leading to Death Speaker Blackthorn."
1144,Executioner Gore,"As Aku'mai's power grows, the need for more sacrifices increases. Dragging screaming innocents to their deaths is Executioner Gore's specialty, and the Twilight's Hammer has been making great use of his services."
1145,Thruk,"Thruk brings many valuable qualities to the Twilight's Hammer, but intelligence is not among them. Convinced that slaying the Guardian of the Deep will reveal vast hoards of gold, Thruk's diminutive mind has no room to focus on anything else and he will fillet the flesh of anyone who breaks his concentration."
1146,Death Speaker Blackthorn,"Death Speaker Blackthorn rose quickly through the ranks of the Death's Head cult after the defeat of Amnennar the Coldbringer. Shortly after usurping control of the cult, Blackthorn began receiving dark whispers. These whispers promised power and riches beyond belief, if he could return Amnennar to life. Compelled by unnatural energies, Blackthorn discovered the location of Amnennar's Phylactery and has returned to Razorfen Downs to complete the ritual that will return his former master to life once more."
1147,Operator Thogar,"Known more for his cruelty and cleverness than for brute strength, Thogar oversees the operation of the Grimrail. From the Foundry's depot, he coordinates the ongoing ground battle against the draenei in Talador, with entire batallions of troops and artillery at his beck and call."
1148,Twin Ogron,"Guarding the entrance to the Gorthenon atop Highmaul, Pol and Phemos are the personal guard of Imperator Mar'gok. Peerless in strength and determination, what these ogron brothers lack in intelligence, they make up for with sheer size and brute force."
1153,Ko'ragh,"Ko'ragh was the only ogre to survive direct exposure to a mysterious relic unearthed by the Highmaul excavations of Nagrand, and was left with a near-complete immunity to all magic. Rumors abound regarding his connection to the Imperator, with some wondering why Ko'ragh would remain subservient to a sorcerer despite his unique gifts."
1154,The Blast Furnace,"The Blackrock clan's unique ability to smelt the black ore, a substance so dense that ordinary flame does not even soften it, has always been their most closely-guarded secret. Deep within the Foundry, their furnace contains a primal force as old as Draenor itself, raging within the confines of its prison as it emanates a preternatural heat."
1155,Hans'gar and Franzok,"Hans'gar and Franzok are twin brothers raised and trained as masterful brawlers of their clan. Both carved paths of glory as warriors, but destiny had other plans. The brothers, each unwilling to slay the other in the rite of mak'gora, were banished from their clan and left for dead. They survived as outcasts in the savage wilds of Draenor, and when the Iron Horde called, these powerful warriors found a new home in the massive war machine."
1160,Ner'zhul,"Ner'zhul, chieftain and elder shaman of the Shadowmoon clan, sacrificed the heart and soul of his tribe in an attempt to join the Iron Horde. He has now retreated to his clan's ancient burial grounds as he ventures ever further along a dark path, embracing the power of the Void and the necromantic arts."
1161,Gruul,"Garrosh knew that the surest path to breaking the gronn lay in subjugating their great father, Gruul. Known in another time as the Dragonkiller, here Gruul has been reduced to the role of menial laborer. In a cruel mockery of the Shattered Hand's warrior tradition, his hand has been replaced with a hook to enable him to more easily haul pallets of fuel to the furnace."
1162,Kromog,"The magnaron are mysterious in their ways, ancient and inscrutable. Miners excavating an expansion to the Foundry, in support of the Iron Horde's massive production needs, were horrified to unearth a chamber containing a living magnaron. To their astonishment, Kromog began to assist in their endeavors, and now uses his massive stone fists to hammer out the gigantic plates needed for the Iron Horde's dreadnaughts and siege machinery."
1163,Nitrogg Thundertower,"With a zeal for flame and explosives, Nitrogg was a natural fit in the mechanized and weaponized army that Garrosh's plans brought to Draenor, and he has risen quickly through the Iron Horde. He oversees the artillery on the Grimrail, and is eager to break through the defenses around Shattrath and conquer the enemies of the Iron Horde within."
1168,Nhallish,"When Ner'zhul tore the fabric of reality and allowed the Void to spill into the ritual burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan, the malefic spirit Nhallish came through that rift in search of souls upon which to feed. Ancient and born of pure darkness, Nhallish seeks to devour all life."
1185,Vigilant Kaathar,The greatest warriors of the draenei may be called upon for one final service as they stand on the precipice of the afterlife: inhabiting one of the armored constructs that serve as the eternal protectors of Auchindoun and the draenei civilization on Draenor. This particular Vigilant is tasked with guarding the last remaining crystal that powers the shield around Auchindoun.
1186,Soulbinder Nyami,"Nyami is a draenei priestess, entrusted as a soultender with access to the holiest grounds within Auchindoun. However, her true loyalties lie with the Shadow Council, and she plots to bring down the barrier that protects the mausoleum from invaders."
1195,Tectus,"An ancient embodiment of the chaotic forces that shaped the terrain of Draenor, Tectus has been twisted and enslaved by the maddened Pale Orcs - who themselves barely maintain control over this imposing force of nature."
1196,Brackenspore,"The Iron Horde juggernaut moored in the waters beside Highmaul drew the attention of Brackenspore, ancient walker of the deep. The aquatic giant spreads fungal growth and moss in his wake, and is driven by primal instinct to eradicate any traces of civilization on Draenor."
1197,Imperator Mar'gok,"As the grand Imperator of Highmaul, Mar'gok is descended from a long line of sorcerers who have ruled the Gorian Empire. Equal parts cunning and brutality, Mar'gok recognized the rising tide of the Iron Horde and what it would mean to oppose them. He has acquiesced to an alliance with Grommash, even as he continues to search for a way to tip the balance of power back into his favor."
1202,Oregorger,"The storehouses of the Blackrock Foundry, laden with heaps and pallets of unprocessed Blackrock ore, represent a grand banquet feast for the ravenous rock-eating goren who have burrowed into the chamber. Oregorger is by far the largest of the invaders, gluttony swelling his frame far beyond the size of any goren previously seen in Draenor."
1203,The Iron Maidens,"With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar'an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the Iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called the Iron Maidens, and have crushed any who have dared face them in battle."
1207,Ancient Protectors,"Gola and Telu, a pair of botani forest-tenders, spread creeping growth as they urge the forest to reclaim and swallow the ill-fated outpost in its midst. Guarding them as they perform this task is the terrible brute Dulhu, long ago a Blackrock clansman who wandered too far into primal woodlands, but now more plant than orc."
1208,Archmage Sol,"Archmage Sol was among the last holdouts of the Kirin Tor expedition at Violet Bluff, but ultimately succumbed to spores that took root in her brain. Perhaps a portion of her humanity remains buried deep within, but she now lives as a prisoner in her own body."
1209,Xeri'tac,"This venomous spider matriarch guards her brood in a cave deep in the hills of Gorgrond, trapping and devouring any prey foolish enough to wander near."
1210,Yalnu,"Ancient and inscrutable, the genesaur Yalnu was drawn to the Kirin Tor outpost in Gorgrond by strange energies radiating from the bluff. For ages the genesaur have battled their eternal foes - the magnaron, the gronn, children of stone - to a stalemate across the world of Draenor. But in these emanations, Yalnu sensed a new world, where his kind could flourish and spread unchecked."
1211,Tarlna the Ageless,"It is said that before Tarlna arrived in Gorgrond, the entire region was a barren wasteland. It is said that verdant life springs up in the wake of each footstep of the ancient genesaur. It is said that the creature is immortal, renewed like a forest in the aftermath of a great blaze. Much is said of Tarlna, but little is truly known or understood."
1214,Witherbark,"Deep within the lush forests of Gorgrond, Witherbark has seen countless cycles of life and death, decay and rebirth. The upstart ""Iron Horde"" and the strange beings that seem to have arrived in their wake are just a new skin on an old snake. They will be gone soon. And Witherbark will endure."
1216,Azzakel,"On Argus - the former homeworld of the draenei, now the stronghold of the Burning Legion - Azzakel waits, poised for a servant of the Legion to open a portal to one of the countless worlds they seek to invade. As Soulbinder Nyami lowers the defenses of Auchindoun, Azzakel senses that his moment is nigh."
1225,Teron'gor,"Working alongside the Sargerei, Gul'dan's agent Teron'gor plots to feast upon the bounty of souls contained within the barriers of the holy mausoleum of Auchindoun."
1226,Orebender Gor'ashan,"A powerful elementalist with a natural affinity for shaping and channeling his powers through metal, Gor'ashan was part of the Iron Horde vanguard in their initial invasion of Azeroth. He bides his time waiting for further orders by attempting to unravel the secrets of the Dark Iron runes left behind by the Spire's creators."
1227,Kyrak,"One of the last remaining survivors of Nefarian's twisted experiments, Kyrak was spared by the Iron Horde and tasked with finding ways to preserve and fortify the few Black Dragonflight eggs remaining in the Spire Rookery. Iron Horde emissaries quickly struck a deal with the cunning dragon."
1228,Commander Tharbek,"A cunning warrior of the Warsong clan, Tharbek was entrusted with the task of leading the expeditionary Ironmarch assault through the Dark Portal. Following Garrosh's instructions, he made his way to the home of the Blackrock orcs in Azeroth to rally forces for the next phase of the operation."
1229,Ragewing the Untamed,"Ragewing is a gargantuan proto-drake raised in the Twilight Highlands by the Dragonmaw clan. Her indomitable spirit has kept her from being broken and used as a mount, although she has formed a close bond with Warlord Zaela herself, following her to Blackrock Spire and roosting in its cavernous halls."
1234,Warlord Zaela,"When Garrosh instructed the Ironmarch vanguard as to their mission in Azeroth, he urged them to rendezvous with an old ally whom he knew would be fierce, loyal, and thirsting for revenge: Zaela, Warlord of the Dragonmaw clan. Now, as she readies a doomsday weapon in the heart of Blackrock Mountain, her moment of vengeance draws near."
1235,Fleshrender Nok'gar,"This fierce Warsong warleader has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Iron Horde, and now commands a battalion of orcish soldiers. From atop his wolf Dreadfang, he surveys their drilling and preparation as they ready themselves to lead a naval assault on Shattrath."
1236,Grimrail Enforcers,"The Grimrail Enforcers are elite mercenaries in the employ of the Blackfuse Company, hired to protect the trains that run through Gorgrond. The trio consists of a Burning Blade swordsman, a goblin engineer, and a shaman who is versed in dark blood magic. The sole threads that bind them are greed and zeal for killing."
1237,Oshir,"Once a savage predator who prowled the Spires of Arak, feared and respected within his pride, the saberon Oshir fell into a Thunderlord snare and was brought to Gorgrond to be broken and trained as an Iron Horde combatant. Not a day passes that Oshir does not dream of tasting his captors' blood."
1238,Skulloc,"The mighty gronn Skulloc represents one of the great successes of the Iron Horde's subjugation of the giants of Gorgrond. Towering over the Grom'kar forces, and fitted with a pair of cannons that would feel at home on any ironclad warship, Skulloc stands ready to unleash destruction at the behest of his new masters."
1262,Rukhmar,"Rukhmar occasionally appears as a blazing firehawk soaring through the skies high above the Spires of Arak. The origins of the great bird are unknown, though Rukhmar is venerated as a deity by the arakkoa, seen as an embodiment of the sun itself."
1291,Drov the Ruiner,"Drov was called Ruiner by the Blackrock clans of old, who quickly learned to give the fearsome magnaron a wide berth. Drov carves a swath of devastation where he walks, as though the earth itself senses his arrival and parts to make way."
1372,Gorefiend,"Falling into the heart of the mausoleum Auchindoun, the Shadow Council lieutenant Teron'gor gorged upon hundreds of draenei souls, becoming a bloated abomination in the process. More than just an orc now, Teron'gor gave up his old name and has taken a new one: Gorefiend."
1391,Fel Lord Zakuun,"Speculated by some scholars of the Legion to be an evolved version of the common felguard, Fel Lords serve as enforcers in the direct service of Archimonde. Their cruelty is matched only by their brute force. Zakuun was set to a task that called upon both of these traits in equal measure: breaking the iron will of a stubborn and defiant orc chieftain of the Warsong Clan...."
1392,Kormrok,"As ancient as Draenor itself, Kormrok once ruled Gorgrond, the creatures of the land slinking away from the giant magnaron's destructive fury. But then the Iron Horde came, trapping the behemoth and attempting to break his will. They were entirely unsuccessful... that is, until the rise of Gul'dan, and the fel power that Kormrok could not resist."
1394,Tyrant Velhari,"When Gul'dan brought his gift to the Sargerei, Velhari had already made her ambitions clear and risen through the ranks with brutal ferocity. Known to her enemies as the Tyrant, Velhari was one of the first to accept the fel touch, further enhancing her combat prowess. Velhari now bears a mockery of the holy symbol of the Naaru, signifying her conviction to the new order."
1395,Mannoroth,"Bloodthirsty and brutal, Mannoroth was Archimonde's most feared enforcer, until he was felled by a mighty blow from Grommash's blade. Even in death, his blood was used by Gul'dan to fuel a dark bargain with the Iron Horde and their allies. Gul'dan and his minions now seek to reanimate the shattered remains of Mannoroth, that he may continue to serve the Legion."
1396,Kilrogg Deadeye,"Kilrogg Deadeye, Warlord of the Bleeding Hollow, seized control of his clan after performing a ritual to learn of his death. With this knowledge, he led his clan fearlessly on countless campaigns, marching toward the glorious end he desires. Now, with demon blood coursing through his veins, Kilrogg awaits you in Hellfire Citadel, awaiting the moment of his death, or yours."
1425,Iron Reaver,"The schematics for the Iron Reaver were found in the workshop of Blackfuse himself after the fall of Orgrimmar, drawing inspiration from the mighty constructs of the Legion and designed to be the nefarious goblin's masterwork. The project was completed after his death, and represents the pinnacle of the Iron Horde's military might."
1426,Hellfire Assault,"With the aid of the mercenary Blackfuse company, the Iron Horde constructed devastating siege machinery in the shadow of Hellfire Citadel, to be used in the eventual assault upon Azeroth's capitals. With the tanks now retrofitted to use fel energy, Siegemaster Mar'tak awaits Gul'dan's command to begin the assault."
1427,Socrethar the Eternal,"The greatest warriors of the draenei have their souls imbued into gleaming constructs, serving as eternal Vigilants in defense of their people. Originally a member of the Council of Exarchs before his descent into darkness, Socrethar has perverted this holiest of rituals, and used a warped fel construct to preserve his soul after his defeat in Talador."
1432,Hellfire High Council,"Thousands of Iron Horde orcs accepted the blood of Mannoroth, but few grew as powerful as these three champions. Dia Darkwhisper, master of Void magic and an outcast of the Shadowmoon, rose quickly to power as the left hand of Gul'dan. Gurtogg, with his insatiable hunger for blood, emerged the victor in hundreds of trials by combat. He has met his match only once, fighting Blademaster Jubei'thos to a draw. Tainted with fel sickness, they serve Gul'dan as both Highguard and Council of War."
1433,Shadow-Lord Iskar,"After Iskar's efforts to resurrect Terokk and return to power ended in frustration, he was approached by Gul'dan with an offer and a promise to break the ancient curse of Sethe. No longer flightless, elevated from the shadows yet still a master of illusion and deception, Iskar's hour of vengeance is at hand."
1438,Archimonde,"One of the original eredar who betrayed the draenei of Argus to take his place as the sinister hand of the dark titan Sargeras, Archimonde the Defiler commands the military might of the Burning Legion. He arrives in Draenor, reaching across space and time, to ensure that the invasion of Azeroth proceeds as planned, and that Gul'dan does not fail his Legion masters."
1447,Xhul'horac,"Summoned by Gul'dan from the depths of the Twisting Nether, Xhul'horac is one of most powerful of the Void Revenants - a race of parasitic void-beings that tear holes through the planes of reality, consuming and absorbing the energies and beings within. Gul'dan has twisted Xhul'horac, feeding him overwhelming Fel energy, and using his powers to tear open the portals through which he plans to rally the forces of the Burning Legion."
1452,Supreme Lord Kazzak,"Supreme Lord Kazzak has emerged from the Twisting Nether once again, watching over Gul'dan's efforts on behalf of the Burning Legion. He stands near the Throne of Kil'jaeden, the heart of the corruption that has befallen Tanaan Jungle."
1467,Tirathon Saltheril,"Once ally to the Master, Tirathon made a bargain with the Legion in exchange for more power. Embittered after years of imprisonment, Tirathon is eager to dole out pain and suffering to whomever crosses his path. If that happens to be one of his former captors, then so much the better."
1468,Ash'golm,"Ash'golm was one of Ragnaros' lieutenants who burned a violent scar across the forests of Kalimdor before the Wardens finally managed to bind him. Unable to fully destroy Ash'golm, the Wardens locked him in a prison of ice. Unfortunately, the recent incursion by the Legion has weakened the countermeasures that kept Ash'golm frozen all these years...."
1469,Glazer,"Like many demons of this type, Glazer can focus his gaze into a potent weapon against his enemies. The Wardens discovered that the creature's magical emissions could be reflected back to their source, to debilitating effect. They used this knowledge to ensnare the demon, and crafted a special prison of mirrors to contain its power. Until now."
1470,Cordana Felsong,"Traitor. Betrayer. Outcast. Cordana was among the vanguard that pursued Garrosh into the Dark Portal, fighting by Khadgar's side and working to thwart the influence of the Shadow Council. But Gul'dan's dark sorcery wormed its way into her heart, turning her into the warlock's ultimate pawn. Once a paragon of duty, she will now forever be known as the instrument of the Wardens' undoing."
1479,Serpentrix,"The naga camped at the Eye of Azshara keep a healthy distance from its northern reaches. An ancient scaled beast makes its home in the shallows there, occasionally bursting forth with one if its many snake-like necks to devour nearby prey."
1480,Warlord Parjesh,"This fierce commander oversees the military might of the naga that have overrun Azsuna in search of the Tidestone of Golgonnath. He is second only to Athissa among the Hatecoil, and commands obedience with an equal measure of fear and respect."
1485,Hymdall,"Clad in gleaming golden armor, with an imposing frame that looks to have been chiseled from granite, Hymdall remains ever vigilant at the gates of the Halls of Valor. Tasked by Odyn to keep the unworthy from entering the Halls, with deadly storm drakes circling nearby ready to heed the call of his horn, he will never falter in his charge."
1486,Hyrja,"In life Hyrja was a warrior without equal, defending the Valkyra from all threats. Her valor and courage drew the attention of Eyir, a titan watcher.  Upon her death and ascension to the Halls of Valor Eyir has awarded Hyrja with her greatest honor, transformation into a Val'kyr."
1487,Fenryr,"In the Fields of the Eternal Hunt, the greatest vrykul champions keep their skills sharp, competing to see who can fell the largest beast. But man and beast alike give a wide berth to the fearsome worg Fenryr, true master of the Fields, who stalks his prey and pounces with unnerving quickness."
1488,God-King Skovald,"Gul'dan approached the vrykul king Skovald with a simple proposition: he could join the Legion and receive ultimate power, or he would see his people destroyed. Dreaming of conquest and glory, Skovald has taken up the Legion's offer, and been set to a single crucial task. He must claim the Aegis of Aggramar from Odyn in the Halls of Valor and deliver it to Gul'dan. Only then can his endless conquest begin."
1489,Odyn,"Odyn, a titan keeper, was empowered by the titan Pantheon to lead the titan-forged armies against the Old Gods. In the aftermath, he raised the Halls of Valor into the skies, assembling a force of the greatest vrykul champions to defend Azeroth. But when Ulduar fell into the clutches of Yogg-Saron, he was betrayed by Loken and cursed by Helya, now trapped within these halls for eternity."
1490,Lady Hatecoil,"This naga sea witch hails from a long line of Hatecoil nobility, favored by Queen Azshara herself. The waves and the skies heed her call, as she harnesses their power to crush any who would oppose the Hatecoil."
1491,King Deepbeard,"Sailors tell of a behemoth that strides the ocean floor, surging from the depths to tear vessels apart with his bare hands. They say he wears the intact prow of a ship as a pauldron--as a trophy. Most listeners dismiss these reports as fools' tales, the product of too much grog."
1492,Wrath of Azshara,"One of Azshara's most loyal handmaidens offered herself willingly to her Queen to serve as the instrument of her vengeance. Summoned by Hatecoil channelers as a last resort after Parjesh's failure, the terrifying Wrath of Azshara exists to wash away all landwalkers who would stand against her."
1497,Ivanyr,"Cut off from the power of the Nightwell and cast into the dark expanse of the Arcway, Ivanyr wandered aimlessly, slowly withering away, until he came upon a trove in the foundations beneath the great library of Suramar. He spends his days feverishly working to decipher the tomes there, feeding off the power of relics in the achives in order to sustain himself. But even as that magic sustains his body, his mind cracks and weakens."
1498,Corstilax,"This massive construct patrols the tunnels beneath Suramar, searching for anomalies and correcting them. He has detected one such anomaly - a breach in one of the conduits that carries the power of the Nightwell - and works to repair it. But living outsiders wandering the tunnels are also an anomaly; one that Corstilax is empowered to remedy."
1499,General Xakal,"When Gul'dan threatened Suramar with destruction if Elisande did not comply with his demands, those were not idle words. A Legion invasion force has burrowed into the tunnels beneath the city, and Xakal leads those forces. He awaits further command, ready at a moment's notice to surge forth and bring death and destruction to the streets of Suramar."
1500,Nal'tira,"This massive spider made its nest in the hollow beneath a great mana tree. Over the years, loose magical energies and runoff have warped the creature, imbuing Nal'tira with arcane energy that makes her perhaps the deadliest predator in the Arcway."
1501,Advisor Vandros,"Vandros is one of Elisande's closest advisors, and an adept at harnessing the arcane magic of the Nightwell, second only to Elisande herself. He would not ordinarily venture into the Arcway himself, but after monitoring the state of the nightfallen resistance and their allies, he now feels the need to take matters into his own hands."
1502,"Ymiron, the Fallen King","Ymiron, one-time king of the vrykul of Northrend, was a mighty warrior held in awe by his people. The gates of the Halls of Valor awaited him in the afterlife. But, hungry for more power, he struck a dark bargain with the Lich King. When adventurers struck him down, he found the eternal Halls closed to him. And so, the damned king waits in purgatory on the shores of the Maw of Souls."
1512,Harbaron,"The mysterious ferryman of souls stands at the helm of the Naglfar, gathering the damned and bringing them to Helya's domain. His connection with the fallen queen of the val'kyr is unclear, but when the breeze catches Harbaron's cloak, an expanse of shimmering stars unfolds beneath. Strange."
1518,The Amalgam of Souls,Immense soul energy was released when Gul'dan conducted the ritual to sever Illidan's soul from his body at Black Rook Hold. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home - and residual soul energy has merged them into a massive monstrosity.

1637,Flame Leviathan,This massive armored tank guards the courtyard entrance in Ulduar. The watcher Mirmiron constructed the Flame Leviathan as part of his V0-L7R-0N weapons platform.
1638,Ignis the Furnace Master,"Like the other titan-forged creations in Ulduar, Ignis now serves the twisted will of the Old God Yogg-Saron. This imposing fire giant toils over the Colossal Forge, creating the iron armies that will conquer Azeroth in Yogg-Saron's name."
1639,Razorscale,"Veranus, broodmother of the proto-drakes in the Storm Peaks, served the keeper Thorim until she was captured by Loken and twisted into a vicious weapon. Under his master's orders, Ignis the Furnace Master fused iron plates onto Razorscale's hide to enhance her deadly strikes."
1640,XT-002 Deconstructor,"Engineered to patrol the Ulduar scrapyard, Mimiron invested his clockwork creation with a rudimentary intellect that suited his duties. XT-002 has come to look upon himself as the keeper's son, and often throws tantrums like a petulant child."
1641,The Assembly of Iron,"The iron legions of Loken are commanded by three fearsome generals, each representing a different titan-forged race. Stormcaller Brundir, Runemaster Molgeim, and the giant Steelbreaker fight in the name of the keeper's true master, the malevolent Yogg-Saron."
1642,Kologarn,Loken commanded Ignis the Furnace Master to fashion this towering giant to guard the Shattered Walkway. His massive arms allow Kologarn to pulverize any intruders attempting to reach the inner sanctum.
1643,Auriaya,"Ulduar's archivist patrols the Observation Ring accompanied by ferocious cats. Years of solitude have weighed heavily on Auriaya, and the Old God's growing power seems to have destroyed the last shreds of her sanity."
1644,Hodir,"The giant Hodir once presided over the Temple of Winter, lending his guidance to the frost giants in the Storm Peaks. Now the watcher dwells in an ice cave in the Halls of Winter, forced to serve the will of Yogg-Saron."
1645,Thorim,"For years, Thorim believed that ice giants had murdered his beloved wife Sif. Thorim turned his wrath upon his allies and fell into despair. When he learned that his brother Loken was responsible for the crime, Loken captured Thorim and brought him to Ulduar, where the Old God clouded the keeper's mind."
1646,Freya,"The watcher Freya has served as protector of all living things, aided by three stoic elders. Though her conservatory remains lush and verdant, she too has succumbed to the Old God's maddening whispers"
1647,Mimiron,"A brilliant innovator, Mimiron has crafted countless mechanisms throughout the history of Azeroth that have inspired awe and wonder. But since falling under Loken's disturbed influence, this watcher of Ulduar has only constructed machines of war and destruction."
1648,General Vezax,"Strange creatures known as faceless ones lurk in the depths of Ulduar. One of their mightiest commanders, General Vezax, guards the twisted passages leading to the Prison of Yogg-Saron."
1649,Yogg-Saron,"The lucid dream. The monster in your nightmares. The fiend of a thousand faces.

All must bend to the master's will. Your petty quarrels only make him stronger."
1650,Algalon the Observer,"Loken's death triggered a warning to the titan Pantheon that Azeroth had lost its Prime Designate. Algalon the Observer has been dispatched to evaluate the presence of systemic corruption. If necessary, the constellar will trigger the re-origination of the entire world, wiping out all its current inhabitants."
1651,Onyxia,
1652,Halion,
1653,Illysanna Ravencrest,"The daughter of Lord Ravencrest, imprisoned for millennia in the Vault of the Wardens shortly after the War of Ancients, found herself free after Maiev released the demon hunters from their prison. Returning to her ancestral home, she has sacrificed everything - including her very soul - to defend what she could not during the War of the Ancients."
1654,Archdruid Glaidalis,"Glaidalis was once known as among the most talented shapeshifters in all of Azeroth, and the elders of Moonglade would regularly send their most promising disciples to his care for instruction. But as has sadly too often been the case, those who are closest to nature are often the first to fall into the Nightmare's clutches."
1655,Oakheart,"An ancient who formed from an offshoot of Shaladrassil itself, Oakheart has survived the Sundering, the Cataclysm, and countless blights. The ancient was able to weather these storms by drawing strength from the essence of the Dream itself. But now, that wellspring has become his undoing."
1656,Dresaron,"Once a young green drake, tending to whelps in the shadow of the great world tree, Dresaron is now engulfed in nightmare, lost in a fog of hatred and fear. He lashes out with powerful wings and a withering breath, unleashing his rage on any who stumble into his clutches."
1657,Shade of Xavius,"Once a powerful mage, and a councilor to Queen Azshara, Xavius forged a pact with Sargeras to enable the Legion's first invasion of Azeroth. Cursed and tormented in the wake of that defeat, Xavius now projects his true power from the Nightmare into our world, focusing his dark might to break the spirit of his old rival, Malfurion."
1662,Rokmora,"Ularogg Cragshaper's unfinished masterpiece, Rokmora, a massive crystal fury constructed to annihilate all who stand against the Underking. The wild magic used to create this behemoth has yet to take hold, imbuing any piece of Rokmora, attached or not, with Ularogg's malevolent will to crush his enemies."
1663,Helya,"Helya, fallen queen of the val'kyr, was once at Odyn's right hand, raising the spirits of vrykul champions to the Halls of Valor to prepare for the final battle for the fate of Azeroth. But following Loken's betrayal, she was persuaded to join him and turn upon her master. She now lurks in the shadowy realm beneath the world, plotting her revenge."
1664,Smashspite the Hateful,"A brutal, imposing Mo'arg Lieutenant, Smashspite the Hateful led the Legion's invasion of Black Rook Hold and commanded defense of the keep from the air via his colony of felbats."
1665,Ularogg Cragshaper,"Ularogg Cragshaper, an ancient drogbar that has committed his life to the pursuit of power. Through violence and deception, Ularogg rose to become the Underking's trusted advisor. He detests Navarogg for bringing ""intruders"" into their home and will take pleasure in bringing about their violent end."
1667,Ursoc,"Ursoc is one of the Wild Gods. Patron of the furbolg, and closely linked to the druidic power of shapeshifting, the ancient great bear has long been a protector of Azeroth. But as Ursoc slumbered at his shrine in the Grizzly Hills, the world around him was plunged into corruption, and he awoke to torment and nightmare, consuming and twisting his being."
1672,Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest,"Kur'talos Ravencrest, Lord of Black Rook Hold, was the commander of the Kal'dorei Resistance during the War of the Ancients until he was assassinated by Varo'then under the orders of Queen Aszhara. Millennia later, Gul'dan's foul soul magic has awoken Ravencrest's soul, and those of his ancestors, from their eternal repose. The Legion, seeking revenge, gleefully forced his soul into his body and mesmerized him, forcing him to eternally relive the horrors of the War of Ancients."
1673,Naraxas,"Naraxas, mother of monsters, has been worshipped by the drogbar since the Age of Neltharion. Constant sacrifices are made to this creature so she can nurture the generations of horrors the drogbar use against their enemies. One way or another, you must pass through this beast and strike at the Underking before this terror is unleashed on Highmountain."
1686,Mindflayer Kaahrj,"This eldritch creature was captured in the depths of Ulduar, ensared as it lapsed into a catatonic state after the defeat of Yogg-Saron. Since Dalaran arrived at the Broken Isles, the monstrosity has mysteriously awakened, and only the powerful wards of the Violet Hold keep its powers in check."
1687,Dargrul the Underking,"Dargrul is the most powerful Underking since the age of Neltharion. Certain that only he has the right to wield the power of Khaz'goroth, Dargul murdered High Chieftain Ulan and seized the artifact from the Highmountain tauren. Now, he uses the Hammer's power to devastate the region and any who oppose him."
1688,Millificent Manastorm,"An engineering genius of undeniable prowess, Millificent Manastorm seems to be the complete opposite of her husband Millhouse. Smart and resourceful, she is a force to be reckoned with."
1693,Festerface,"Professor Putricide had many experiments seized when Icecrown Citadel fell. At best guess, Festerface appears to be a failed prototype that predated the construction of the professor's two most notorious creations: Rotface and Festergut."
1694,Shivermaw,"Rumored to be one of Sindragosa's own brood, this fearsome frost wyrm was captured from the Frostwing Halls of Icecrown Citadel, where the forces of the Lich King labored to create these winged abominations."
1695,Inquisitor Tormentorum,"Of all the foul creatures that serve the Legion, the hooded inquisitors are perhaps the most mysterious, and most menacing. Tormentorum arrived in the aftermath of the initial assault upon the vault. As he drifts through the halls of the Vault, his gaze piercing the shadows in search of some vital secret, even other demons give him a wide berth."
1696,Anub'esset,"Anub'esset, one of the few remaining ancient Nerubian crypt lords, was captured by the Kirin Tor during the invasion of Icecrown Citadel and imprisoned in Violet Hold. Set free during the Legion's invasion, his thoughts turn only to revenge against the living."
1697,Sael'orn,"These origins of these arachnid demons are not fully understood - scholars who have studied the Legion speculate that they are the remnants of a forgotten race on a world long ago conquered by the armies of Sargeras. Sael'orn is a particularly vicious specimen, and has been tasked with leading the infiltration of Dalaran."
1702,Blood-Princess Thal'ena,"Blood-Princess Thal'ena is the daughter of the powerful San'layn Queen Lana'thel. She has been locked inside Violet Hold since the Northrend campaign, suffering the gnawing pain of her eternal hunger. Now that her cell has opened, she intends to feed on the world."
1703,Nythendra,"Nythendra was once a member of the Green Dragonflight charged with guarding the world tree, Shaladrassil. When Xavius' corruption of the Nightmare consumed Shaladrassil, it consumed the sleeping guardian as well. Nythendra is now nothing more than a skeletal version of herself, swarming in pestilence, ready to devour anyone or anything foolish enough to enter her lair."
1704,Dragons of Nightmare,"The Emerald Dream was entrusted to Ysera for safekeeping, and the mightiest of her green dragon brood were assigned to stand watch over four portals that connected directly to Azeroth. But even before the Cataclysm, these dragons began to show signs of corruption. Now, the path to the Nightmare's core runs through the dragons' lair."
1706,Skorpyron,"Deep within the foundations of the Nighthold, beneath the sea, lie long-forgotten vaults that give access to the Nightwell itself. This monstrous armored scorpid has made its home in one of these vaults. Infused with the power of the Nightwell, and surrounded by a teeming brood, Skorpyron presents a serious complication to an otherwise-promising back entry to the Nighthold."
1711,Fel Lord Betrug,This ruthless Legion commander stands ready to lead an invasion of Dalaran from within its walls.
1713,Krosus,"This colossal doom lord, one of the largest and mightiest creatures in the armies of the Legion, was defeated at the Broken Shore through the combined might of the greatest heroes of the Horde and the Alliance. Having recovered from his wounds, Krosus emerges from the bay between the Nighthold and the Tomb of Sargeras to crush any who would oppose the Legion."
1718,Patrol Captain Gerdo,"Captain of the Duskwatch, Gerdo has devoted his life to keeping the peace within the walls of Suramar. Though he has a growing unease since the arrival of the Legion, he remains faithful and loyal to the leadership of Suramar. Elisande has safeguarded them for generations, and she knows what is best for the people of the city. Tonight, Gerdo's task is to ensure that only citizens with the proper credentials are able to enter a gathering of particular importance at the manor."
1719,Talixae Flamewreath,"A sadistic eredar sorcerer, even as she understands the importance of the nightborne to her master's plans, Talixae chafes at the indignity of standing guard over a building full of elves. Nevertheless, she and her lieutenants remain vigilant, and while they live, no intruders will disrupt the gathering."
1720,Advisor Melandrus,"First Blade of the Grand Magistrix, Melandrus rarely leaves Elisande's side. He has eschewed the magical arts, instead harnessing the power of the Nightwell to heighten his reflexes and his movements to inhuman levels."
1725,Chronomatic Anomaly,"The cavern at the base of the Nightwell is a maelstrom of raw energy, as the power to fuel an entire civilization courses from the earth. Born from this chaotic flux, the Chronomatic Anomaly is an embodiment of the power of the Eye of Aman'thul. As it lashes out with energy attacks, the bursts of energy warp the very flow of time."
1726,Xavius,"Once a powerful mage, and a councilor to Queen Azshara, Xavius forged a pact with Sargeras to enable the Legion's first invasion of Azeroth. Cursed and tormented in the wake of that defeat, Xavius plots vengeance against the world from within the Rift of Aln. Those who venture into the Nightmare will face the full extent of his power, and his true form - a grotesque and distended monstrosity."
1731,Trilliax,"Trilliax, once proud servant to the nightborne aristocracy, has been discarded and left to slowly deteriorate among other surplus constructs. While an unwavering will to carry out its tasks remains, the passage of time has splintered this construct's personality matrix. It now unpredictably switches from one mode to the next, ranging from doting caretaker to homicidal sterilizer, craving recognition and validation from a master that no longer exists."
1732,Star Augur Etraeus,"The nightborne astromancer Etraeus has devoted long years of research to scouring the skies of Azeroth, seeking answers to the great mysteries of the universe. His scrying has shown him worlds beyond our ken, and the power of the Nightwell allows him to draw upon the essence of those worlds to amplify his own powers."
1737,Gul'dan,"The chain of events set in motion when Garrosh escaped to Draenor has continued, unbroken for all its twists and turns, leading to this very moment. Thwarted in Draenor, Gul'dan now stands on the precipice of achieving ultimate victory on behalf of his Legion masters. Standing atop the Nighthold, as the vortex of fel energy swirls in the skies overhead, the outcast orc warlock awaits his destiny."
1738,"Il'gynoth, Heart of Corruption","Lodged in the hollows of a now-decrepit world tree, Il'gynoth is a manifestation of the horrors that lie at the heart of the Nightmare. It is a mass of corruption - a thing that should not be. Its tendrils seep through the ground, emerging in countless horrifying eyestalks and limbs."
1743,Grand Magistrix Elisande,"Elisande once distinguished herself by resisting the Legion. She and her highborne followers broke away from Queen Azshara and the dark path she was taking, harnessing the power of the Eye of Aman'thul to create the Nightwell to protect Suramar from the Sundering. But over ten thousand years later, the Legion's arrival offered her no such recourse. She has cast her lot with the demons, hoping to once again use the power of the Nightwell - albeit this time in a very different sense - to save her people."
1744,Elerethe Renferal,"Elerethe, once a mighty druid and adept shapeshifter, was led down a dark path by the belief that she was betrayed by her closest allies. Her consciousness now resides in the nightmare, damning her to an existence of fear, confusion, and hatred."
1749,Nithogg,"The great dragon Nithogg was once of the Thorignir, having left the brood shortly after they swore fealty to the titan keepers. Nithogg believed that one day he would be more powerful than even the keepers, and refused to be their subject. Instead, he took up roost in the mountain Nastrondir, where he raises his brood and terrorizes the nearby lands whenever the mood strikes him."
1750,Cenarius,"The demigod Cenarius is the father of druidism in Azeroth, and one of Azeroth's oldest and most powerful protectors. His disturbing slumber within the groves of Val'sharah was the first sign of the depth of the growing threat from within the Nightmare. That dark power now has complete hold over him, and he may lie beyond hope of redemption."
1751,Spellblade Aluriel,"Aluriel always had an affinity for magic. She rose through the ranks of the Nightguard effortlessly, having a natural talent with the sword. But no matter how strong she became, she wanted more. She studied with the mages at the University of Suramar, spending her days in combat training and her evenings in the artificery. She forged her weapons and armor in the Nightwell, weaving magic spells into the precious metals. She is the first Spellblade, adept in the schools of Fire, Frost and Arcane."
1756,The Soultakers,"Sent by Helya to raid the crypts of noble vrykul kings, this trio of raiders and their crew has found their way into the Tomb of the Old Kings and seek to claim the souls that rest there."
1761,High Botanist Tel'arn,"From his youth, the nightborne Tel'arn was fascinated by plant life: the resilience and adaptability of weeds, the ability of simple grass to harness the power of the sun, the way a tree may be divided into two, or two branches grafted into one. Aided by the energies of the Nightwell, he has transformed himself to the point that he is scarely recognizable as a nightborne elf. He now considers himself something far, far greater."
