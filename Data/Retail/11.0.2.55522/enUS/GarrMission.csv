516,[PH] Test Mission 4,Frostfire Ridge,[ph] description
517,Blockade: Zangar Sea,Zangar Sea,The Horde have set up a blockade around their garrison.  Break through and you can raid the Horde navy.
518,Blockade: Barrier Sea,Barrier Sea,Assault the Iron Horde defense in the Barrier Sea to unlock access to the waters around Tanaan.  Success grants access to Hellfire Citadel naval missions.
519,Blockade: Evanescent Sea,Evanescent Sea,The Alliance have set up a blockade around their garrison.  Break through to raid and plunder.
520,Blockade: South Sea,The South Sea,Push the Iron Horde out of the South Seas by defeating their blockade.  Success grants access to the primal resources around Nagrand.
522,The Second Time is the Charm,Zangar Sea,"Now that our ships are more equipped, re-engage the enemy.  It's lurking in the same area."
523,The Second Time is the Charm,Lion's Watch,"Now that our ships are more equipped, re-engage the enemy.  It's lurking in the same area."
524,Sink or Swim,[ph],You've never lived until you've taken down an enemy vessel while you're both flirting with watery disaster.
525,Broken Horn Village,[ph],These destroyers plan to shell a Laughing Skull village near the Iron Docks. It's our closest foothold against the Iron Horde. We can't lose it.
526,Sneaking.  Sea Style.,Evanescent Sea,We designed submarines specifically to sneak up on unsuspecting carriers.  We've set up a carrier in the reef for you to practice.
527,Fine Tuning Depth Charges,[ph],We've set up submarines at different depths in Frostfire Bay.  Take a destroyer out and train them in the art of sub hunting.
528,While the Iron Is Hot,[ph],"Although goren infest the Molten Quarry, iron ore is plentiful there. So are Alliance scum. Don't let that destroyer secure their grip on the area."
529,Shattered Light,[ph],"Demons and Shadow Council agents have overrun much of Shattrath. Even so, we will keep fighting. We shall not yield while the Alliance still stands."
530,Retaining Control,Azsuna - Faronaar,We've heard rumors of a powerful new demon presence in Faronaar. We should investigate before it threatens our hold on the area.
531,The Light Reveals,Azsuna,There is a powerful beacon of the Light somewhere in Azsuna. We should find it.
532,A Friend In Need,Azsuna - Kirin Tor Shore [PH],Senegos' prime consort has sent out a cry for help. We owe it to our allies to send aid.
533,Toxic Behavior,[ph],Iron Horde forces have been harvesting potent toxins in the Writhing Mire and using them in combat. Now they're shipping a batch of toxins north.
534,Skeleton Crew,[ph],"This sub just limped back home for repairs, only to find the harbor nearly deserted. Finish off the sub while we keep the enemy busy elsewhere."
535,Riders on the Storm,[ph],These two vessels are heading south in a hurricane. Even Hellscream wouldn't have sent them out unless their mission was dire. We must intercept them.
536,Hoard Overboard,[ph],"Rumor has it a cargo fleet recently sank out here, far from land. Unfortunately we're not the only ones who've heard this rumor."
537,Windroc Bay,[ph],Surely these vessels are just ferrying bird enthusiasts to the bay. Not beast tamers who plan to enslave its massive hydras for the Iron Horde. Surely.
538,The Sunset Shore,[ph],The Iron Horde uses subs to transport gold up and down the western coast. Taking one out would hit Hellscream's pocket and fill our coffers.
539,Glittering Prize,[ph],"This enemy sub is loaded with gold, so it can't outrun us. Instead, it's been hiding out between a rocky shoal and a whirlpool, hoping to lure us to our doom."
540,False Economy,[ph],A damaged engine has crippled a destroyer far from shore. That's what happens when you only value warriors and plunder. Not that the gold should go waste.
541,No Loss of Suction,[ph],"While mutineers were seizing this destroyer, storms broke out, and a whirlpool ensnared the ship. That's bad luck. And thanks to us, it's about to get worse."
542,A Sunless Sea,[ph],"In this poor weather, Hellscream has sent subs to harry our fleet. Act decisively so that they never again see the light of day."
543,Blood in the Water,[ph],"Enemy destroyers are terrorizing the waters west of the Spires of Arak. Crushing them won't restore the lives that've been lost, but it'd be a good start."
544,Dead Calm,[ph],"With no wind and a ripped mainsail, an enemy carrier has slowed to a crawl, along with its escorts. Make sure their troops and cargo never make landfall."
545,Wrack and Rune,[ph],"Enemy subs have taken a sudden interest in this area. They may be tracking down an elemental rune. In the wrong hands, it could prove devastating."
546,Fury of the Elements,[ph],Storms have broken out around the Ancestral Grounds. The enemy vessel off the coast may be to blame. Also the fact that most shaman loathe the Iron Horde.
547,Un-sub-tle,[ph],"Evidently Hellscream thought subs might be a safer way to transport elemental runes. Safer, yes. Sneaky, no."
548,Turn! Turn! Turn!,[ph],Hellscream should realize by now that the elements won't willingly serve the Iron Horde. And trying to compel their obedience is unwise.
549,One Way or Another,[ph],Lately the Iron Horde has been gathering magical items. They've learned brute force can't solve everything. Remind them it still has its uses.
550,Abracadabra,[ph],A shipment of abrogator stones is on its way to Grommashar. We must intercept it. The Iron Horde is trouble enough without a bunch of magical gems.
551,Magical Mystery Cruise,[ph],"An enemy carrier has veered off course, and it's emanating powerful magic. Something odd is afoot. Find out what. More importantly, claim that magic."
552,A Kind of Magic,[ph],"Several magi and their schooner have been taken into the Iron Horde's ""protection"". Rescue the magi. Their gratitude could pay well."
553,Ru'klaa,[ph],"Iron Horde vessels are often attacked by lobstrok here, and so Hellscream means to slay their matriarch. Coming to her aid would be in our best interests."
554,Talk to the Fist,[ph],"Northwest of Talador, offshore, is an unyielding rock vise called the Colossal's Fist. The Iron Horde hasn't yet discovered it. Arrange an introduction."
555,The White Kraken,[ph],"Captain Ironbeard is a deadly menace on the seas, but he's obsessed with a kraken that doesn't exist. Distract him and then launch a sneak attack."
556,Storm Front,[ph],"Shattered Hand forces just dispatched these vessels, which headed straight into a storm. Their recklessness will work to our advantage."
557,Subtle Plans Are Here Again,[ph],Subtlety isn't really Hellscream's strong suit. Probably these ships thought the mountains would hide their approach.
558,Spoiling for a Fight,[ph],"So what if they're nowhere near Horde or Alliance waters? Sooner or later, they will be."
559,Felblazer,[ph],"These ships were loaded with containers of raw fel before they left Ironhold Harbor. Wherever they're headed, we must destroy them and their deathly cargo."
560,"Oops, We Hit Them Again",[ph],The Iron Horde keeps sending fresh workers and supplies to the Dark Portal. Should we take pity and let their ships through so they can rebuild it? No.
561,Try Evading This,[ph],"These bastards have been playing tag with our forces, landing hits on our forces, only to evade our counterattacks. It's hurting our troops and their morale."
562,To Fel and Back,[ph],Kilrogg Deadeye has made his choice. Now his Bleeding Hollow orcs travel to Hellfire Citadel and return to Tanaan empowered by demonic blood.
563,Warspear Fishing,[ph],"Hellscream has posted a sub near the Horde's main base on Ashran. Take that sub out. Alliance, that means you, too. Factional hatreds have no place here."
564,If a Tree Falls in the Forest,[ph],"Iron Horde forces have landed in Tangleheart, endangering its rich soil and plentiful timber. Also its powerful ancients. Who were already pretty angry."
565,"A Ship in Harbor Is Safe, But...",[ph],These ships are about to leave Ironhold Harbor. They're probably still hung over from last-minute partying. They're certainly not expecting a fight.
566,Strait and Narrow,[ph],An enemy carrier has seized control of the Darktide Strait. Losing that waterway would hurt Horde shipping concerns worldwide. Our course is clear.
567,Back in My Day...,[ph],A true warrior would only hunt a sub in bad weather. Barefoot. In arctic waters. Against the current. Both ways.
568,"One, Two... Plenty",[ph],"Outmanned thirty to one. Alliance weaklings would call this a risky fight. In the Horde, we call it a target-rich environment."
569,Luck Is Also a Skill,[ph],"Battleship counters destroyer, but carrier counters battleship. Sub counters carrier, but destroyer counters sub. In short, luck will decide this fight."
570,Fools and Their Gold,[ph],"The city of Elodor houses the draenei's leaders, who are allied with the Alliance. Teach both groups a lesson: seize one of their gold shipments."
571,The Shimmer Moor,[ph],"The so-called dragons living here are fragile mounts, but foolish draenei pay well for them. Divert their latest cargo of gold to a better cause: ours."
572,Do You Feel Lucky?,[ph],"When Alliance forces sailed to Shadowmoon, their ship arrived intact. Maybe draenei aren't as cursed as we thought. Maybe they even brought gold with them."
573,"Skulls, Spikes, Everything Nice",[ph],The mail armor in this vessel's cargo hold will serve us well once we spice it up a bit.
574,Look Good in Leather,[ph],This vessel is taking a cargo full of leather armor to Alliance fighters in Zeth'Kur. Leather shouldn't be wasted on them. Isn't lace more their thing?
575,"A Journey, Not a Destination",[ph],This Alliance carrier is heading for Stormshield with fresh troops and supplies. But it's a long journey between Shadowmoon Valley and Ashran.
576,Far From Home,[ph],Cowardly Alliance dogs have begun targeting our carriers even when they are far from Shadowmoon waters. Show them what a true threat looks like.
577,With Their Boots On,[ph],"The waters around Shadowmoon Valley are regularly patrolled by Alliance subs, but these two are far from shore. They look lonely. Let's send them company."
578,Made for Walking,[ph],"If we steal Alliance-bound boots, and a barefoot Alliance mage trips and dies, would that count as a Horde victory? Why, yes. Plus, hey, new boots."
579,Mayhem by the Moonlit Shore,[ph],Horde vessels wanted for Alliance raid. Must love plunder and long walks on the beach. High tolerance for the colors blue and violet a plus.
580,By Our Bootstraps,[ph],"Alliance forces in Shadowmoon have an easy life. Lush forests, mild weather, supply shipments... maybe even fresh bacon. Make those bastards pay."
581,"Mail Delivery, Rain or Shine",[ph],"The Earthen Ring kindly requests that all plundered mail armor be divided equally among those who wear it. Otherwise, the elements might become displeased."
582,"Steel Fist, Silk Glove",[ph],"A shipment of tailored goods from Shadowmoon Valley is headed for our enemies in Stormshield. Intercept it, and share in the spoils."
583,Say No to Southern Exposure,[ph],"Draenei-crafted plate is just as sturdy as Horde-crafted plate. Tell your soldiers they will seize and wear this cargo, or they will go naked into battle."
584,Circle of Life,[ph],"Another day, another Alliance shipment to Ashran. Are they trying to be stealthy, heading so far east before circling back to Stormshield? Pathetic."
585,The Tanaan Channel,[ph],"An enemy carrier guards the channel entrance. If we take it out, we can storm Scuttler's Coast to the north, and cut off Alliance shipments to the south."
586,Alakazam,[ph],"With Archmage Khadgar elsewhere on business, an enemy vessel has secured the eastern passage into Zangarra. They expect a fight. Let's not disappoint them."
587,"If It Shines, It's Mine",[ph],This vessel is carrying plenty of plate armor; Alliance soldiers just happen to be wearing it. Why are you letting Alliance scum wear your armor?
588,It's a Trap,[ph],This destroyer looks to be disabled far from land. But our scouts report this is just an act: a submarine is circling in the waters below.
589,Heart of the Sea,[ph],These radiant and perilous waters absorbed their magical properties from precious stones lining the sea floor. Such a gem would make a powerful necklace.
590,The Cerulean Lagoon,[ph],"The name sounds peaceful, but your crew should bring gas masks. The atmosphere here tends to be toxic, which is doubtless why the Horde sent a sub."
591,Bring Home the Bacon,[ph],Frostboar Point is tactically worthless; it hardly merits a carrier patrol. Somehow the Horde has discovered our plans to export the area's boars.
592,Spring Is Never Coming,[ph],The orcs who named the Coldsnap Coast didn't mean that its weather was a temporary cold spell. They meant the cold would snap most people in two.
593,The Stonefury Cliffs,[ph],"Bloodmaul ogres live here alongside their ogron masters, who constantly hammer the ground with boulders. All in all, it's a fun getaway spot."
594,Tastes Like Chicken,[ph],Frostangler Bay is a virtual cornucopia of disgusting-looking marine life. But it's palatable enough if you cook it properly. Bring back a fat haul.
595,Come Fel or High Water,[ph],"Horde forces plan to attack the Icescar Boneyard. If they fail, their deaths will only fuel the Shadow Council's foul sorcery. Stop the Horde, whatever it takes."
596,Zangar Shore,[ph],"Several races on Draenor offer excellent pay for these giant mushrooms. That said, the shortsighted Horde will quickly wipe them out if we don't intervene."
597,The Burning Glacier,[ph],"Yes, it's constantly snowing here, but it also has volcanic activity. No, it's never a comfortable temperature. Look, you're not going ashore anyway."
598,Cold Shoulder,[ph],"This far north, Horde forces seem to think themselves safe from our ships. But then thinking never was their strong suit."
599,Mind Over Metal,[ph],"Battleship counters destroyer, but carrier counters battleship. Sub counters carrier, but destroyer counters sub. Thus, skill will be this fight's deciding factor."
600,You Pull a Gun,[ph],"Driven by bloodlust, orc animals target our carriers even when they're far from Frostfire waters. We won't meekly endure this aggression. Strike back."
601,Dead Orcs Don't Need Boots,[ph],Stop complaining. You never know: they might not smell that bad.
602,Far Too Many Notes,[ph],"Our spies have noted regular supply shipments to Wor'gol via the Southwind Cliffs. The Horde hasn't noted our noting them. We've noted that, too."
603,Pedal to the Metal,[ph],"These Horde vessels are rounding Highmaul on their way north. If ogres don't seize their cargo of plate armor, it will soon outfit our enemies. Stop them."
604,Glacier Bay,[ph],"When Horde forces sailed to Frostfire, their ship arrived mostly intact. Perhaps orcs aren't witless brutes. Unless they left behind valuable cargo."
605,Hand-Me-Downs,[ph],Pretend you're getting them from a big brother or sister. But give them a thorough scrubbing before you put them on. Just in case.
606,"The Touch, the Feel",[ph],The orcs of Throm'var are supplying the Horde with fine furs and supple leather. Such a pity they'll be used to garb our boorish foes.
607,Heavy Metal,[ph],"These battleships are so overburdened with cargo, their sailors hardly need to swab the decks. Teach them the value of caution, and lighten their load."
608,Take up the Gauntlet,[ph],Hellscream's forces have recently grown scarce along the Orunai Coast. Now the Horde dares to use it as drop-off point for cargo.
609,Razorfin Grin,[ph],"Take out that enemy supply ship, but act quickly if anyone goes overboard. The orcs don't call it Frostbite Deep for nothing."
610,The Lernaean Shore,[ph],"Procuring quality leather can be tedious, but the Horde plans to shell the hydras here and skin them. Exhausting work. Perfect setup for a lucrative win."
611,Death Metal,[ph],Shipments for Wor'gol must first pass through the Pale Cove's treacherous currents and jagged rocks. That will be the perfect time for us to strike.
612,It's All the Rage,[ph],"Orcish cloth armor is just as soft and comfortable as ours. Tell your magi they will seize and wear this cargo. No exceptions, gnomes. Make it work."
613,"Finders, Keepers",[ph],A Horde warrior bound for Frostfire Ridge clumsily dropped a magic necklace overboard. Put him and his vessel out of their misery.
614,[ph],[ph],[ph]
615,"It's a Boat, It's a Plane, It's... Just a Riverbeast.",[ph],"The Iron Horde swooped in when they identified a rogue submarine closing in on their stronghold.  Unfortunately for them, it was just a riverbeast."
616,The Wave Mistress,[ph],The deep waters of Draenor's oceans have seen many deaths and precious little peace. This ship and its crew are doomed to wander the seas for eternity.
617,On the Rocks,[ph],"This ghost ship lies in wait, attacking unwary sailors who approach the treacherous shoals off Gorgrond's eastern coast."
618,"Blood, Gold, and Regret",[ph],"Seizing a fortune proved this destroyer's undoing. Its crew turned on each other, only to become cursed ghosts, unable to spend the gold they gave their lives for."
619,Orphaned Aquatic Animal Rescue,[ph],A young shark has been abandoned in a storm off the coast of Nagrand.  Defend it from the Iron Horde and it will likely follow you home.
620,Gold in Their Holds,[ph],"Uncharted waters proved deadly to these sailors, who still roam the area as murderous ghosts. That said, they were well paid before their deaths."
621,Unafraid of Ghosts,[ph],"On the one hand, great riches. On the other hand, furious walking corpses. Oh, come now. We all know what choice you're going to make."
622,Nothing Gold Can Stay,[ph],"Sabotaged by spies, these carriers sank on their way to battle. Denied a glorious death in battle, their ghostly crews sink other ships out of bitterness."
623,How to Pierce Thick Armor,[ph],"The hulls of destroyers are so thick, it's impossible to pierce it with normal ammunition.  We've crafted battleships with the sole purpose of penetrating destroyer armor."
624,Transport Escort,[ph],Transport ships are required to deliver troops to battle or to load up valuable cargo.  Take a transport on this training mission and ensure it reaches its destination intact.
625,Sneaking.  Sea Style.,[ph],We designed submarines specifically to sneak up on unsuspecting carriers.  We've set up a carrier in the bay. See if you can sneak up on it.
626,Bomber Target Practice,[ph],The best way to take out battleships is by air.  Take a carrier out and have your ace bomber pilots put some holes into it.
627,[ph],[ph],[ph]

635,Test Mission Anders,A Place,"Should give you a huge success chance boost, if it's the first mission of the day. Also should give you a cool item!"
636,A Little Combat,Tanaan Channel,A Horde sub has been spotted spying around our base.  Take your new destroyer out and end it.
