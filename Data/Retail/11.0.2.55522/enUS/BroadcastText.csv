33996,Loss of life unavoidable.,
33997,I do what I must.,
34001,You are out of time.,
34012,Perhaps it is your imperfections... that which grants you free will... that allows you to persevere against all cosmically calculated odds. You prevail where the Titan's own perfect creations have failed.,
39672,,Captain! Shipwreck off the starboard bow! There appear to be survivors!
41964,Now get your minds right! We'll be killing orcs within the hour.,

42095,Hellscream has sent his best to take this island. We shall see to it that none return home...,

44212,Aaaaaahhh...,
44213,,"Follow me, my pets! The realm of the mighty Neptulon is ours at last!"
44214,"What now, old friend?",
44215,We have suffered a tragic defeat.,
44216,Any hope for the future of our world has grown much bleaker.,
44217,Thrall must be told of this day's events.,

44225,"Well, shaman, what now?",
44226,Erunak! Behind you!,
50471,"May the Light bless the spirits of our ancestors, for they've chosen to allow my son to rest upon this holy ground.",
50472,"It is here, surrounded by the heroes and patriots of Gilneas where he belongs.",
50473,"We'll return, Liam.  I swear this to you.",
50477,"Gilneas will remember your courage forever, Liam.",
56129,"I apologize for the deception, but it was necessary.",
56130,"In thousands of years, we have never seen one of your kind.",
56131,It was imperative that I first measure the bearing of your heart.,
56154,"Come ride with me, little one. There is something I wish you to see.",
57715,"We're gonna turn this place into a sinkhole, heh.",

58171,"I am Anduin Wrynn, Prince of Stormwind. I won't die here. Not like this!",
59411,For Pandaria!,
60365,,It's working! The wound is closing!
60627,,"We risked everything, but we did it. Shen-zin Su will be okay."
61462,Our story begins long ago in the days of the monstrous Emperor Tian.,
61463,The Emperor was in need of trusted messengers and deliverymen.,
61464,"So he took a strange, diminutive cave creature he found and warped it with the powers of the Vale.",
61465,"What he created, was the ""grummle.""",
61470,Let us talk about the nature of power. In my hands I hold a sword. I ask you: Who wields the power?,
61471,"I do, for I wield the sword!",
61495,A grummle can carry five times their own weight. They never sweat. They have an outstanding sense of smell.,
61496,"And their skulls are harder than granite. Curiously, they all appear to be related.",
61497,Ancient Pandaren heroes freed the grummles from slavery.,
61567,"The Yaungol warlord shows his face! Come, let's finish this!",
61643,"Today they still act as traders, messengers, guides, and pack bearers for expeditions high up in Kun-Lai summit.",
61647,"They are a very superstitious people, who often take on the names of their favorite charms, or ""Luckydos.""",
61649,"The grummle suspicious of any luck they cannot smell, so it behooves one to meet new grummles with a pocketful of dung.",
61650,"A very strange race, indeed.",
61798,"Many thousands of years ago, the mogu held all the power. They ruled this land with fists of iron. But as their empire grew, they needed a way to police and control it.",
61799,"They used the powers of the Vale, and their own flesh-warping magics, to twist and shape a race of ferocious lizards into a living weapon. They created an army. An army of Saurok. Bloodthirsty savages created to enforce the will of the emperor.",
61800,"Ah, but there is a problem with creating a living weapon. Do you see?",
61801,"Who, now, wields the power?",
61802,"The heartless saurok, even with their tiny lizard brains, soon realized the truth of their position. They killed the enemies of the mogu.",
61803,Then they killed the subjects of the mogu.,
61804,"Soon, they started killing the mogu themselves.",
61805,"The mogu emperor then ordered all of the saurok to be purged. He tried to wipe out their entire race, to no avail. They still plague Pandaria to this day.",
61806,"So you see - power is easily taken, but should not be lightly given.",
61828,,"Ready when you are, $p."
61979,,"Come $p, let me show you."
61980,,Look through the spyglass.
61981,,The Sha of Hatred is inside that mantid structure... I suspect it was drawn to a powerful host there.
61982,,"To get in, we will need specially tuned crystals from some of the mantid leaders in the area."
61983,,I located these leaders here...
61984,,here...
61985,,and here.
61986,,Kill them.  Take the crystals.  Should be simple enough.
62624,"My, my. Hello, stranger! Sampled my dream brew, have we? Its visions are hard to interpret - half truth, half illusion. Who's to say which is which?",
62776,What the...?,
62777,What was that noise?,
62778,"It came from the wall, sir.",
62779,"I know where it CAME from, what was it?",
62781,No... no...,
62782,Men! To arms!,
62783,You three! $n! Assist Captain Oakenshield in the front!,
62784,Greentill! Blacksoil! Cover our left flank! I don't want any surprises!,
62785,"Leven, take the right side! You're on your own!",
62786,"Everyone else! If you can hold a weapon, protect the village! Don't let them past this line! You...",
62789,We don't stand a chance...,
62790,"Everyone, fall back! FALL BA-",
62791,Rrrraaaa!!!,
62792,Who are you?,
62794,Does it matter who we are? We are here to help you.,
62795,Hey! Gimme one o' them pitchforks!,
62796,You were surrendering? Why? Because these invaders can break down a wall?,
62797,You have got another wall... and it's made up of the people who call this place HOME.,
62798,Any one of us would lay down our life to protect this land.,
62799,"This land, it belongs to us...",
62800,It belongs to our ancestors...,
62801,It belongs to our children.,
62802,And we are not about to let that change.,
63378,You are too late! The Thunder King will rise and take dis land from you.,
63387,How did they find us? Ready your weapons - we've got to get out of this canyon!,
63691,Oh... I seem to have lost my sword.,
63692,"When the Sundering ripped apart the continents of Azeroth, we pandaren thought that the rest of the world had been utterly destroyed.",
63693,"But as the centuries passed, one young explorer decided to see what was out there. His name was Liu Lang. And he set out to discover the world... on the back of a turtle!",
63694,"We celebrate his bravery with statue and song, but if you were actually there on the beach that very day - well, I'm sure he looked quite silly, indeed.",
63695,"Oh, how the pandaren laughed at him. But Liu Lang was more clever than anyone thought. Sea turtles always return to the beach where they were born. And so, despite the mists that envelop our land, he always had a way home.",
63696,"Every few years, he returned - with tales of mysterious cities in the sand, nomadic people living on endless grassy plains, a great empire under the ice, and a magical kingdom gilded in gold.",
63697,"Each time he returned, more and more pandaren answered Liu Lang's call, and joined him on his growing turtle. They were the bravest among us: The explorers. The adventurers.",
63698,"And that is the lesson of Liu Lang, my friend. Everyone always laughs at the explorer. They always laugh... until he returns.",
63699,Great events often have humble beginnings. Consider: a quiet pond. Still. The water is like a sheet of glass.,
63700,"Until I throw a stone. Such a small thing - but soon, ripples engulf the whole of the lake!",
63701,"The jinyu also have humble origins. Once primitive creatures, they were fortunate enough to live near the enchanted pools within the Vale.",
63702,"The magic of the pools expanded their minds and grew their bodies, until they became one of the great ancient cultures of Pandaria.",
63703,The wisest of the jinyu are very wise indeed - they can speak to the rivers the way you and I would consult our elders.,
63704,"In the whispering waters, they can hear the future.",
63705,The jinyu and their waterspeakers stand at the very heart of the greatest events in Pandaria's history.,
63706,"Their visions built empires, freed slaves, and warned our Last Emperor of the Sundering that shattered Azeroth ten thousand years ago.",
63707,"Think about it: the smallest voice can change the world. Consider that, friend, the next time you decide to start throwing stones!",
63708,"Oh, my student - you wish to study the mantid? Be warned: the pandaren frontier is littered with the graves of former pupils.",
63709,The mantid are harsh teachers.,
63710,"Every generation, the mantid swarm the Serpent's Spine wall in great numbers. They murder many pandaren, so we kill many times their number in return. Yet each generation, they attack once more. Why do they do this?",
63711,We pandaren do not know.,
63712,Our ancient writings indicate that the mantid have always been here. They predate even the mogu. Where did they come from?,
63713,We pandaren do not know.,
63714,"Perhaps, if you were to befriend the mantid, and earn a reputation among them, they would teach you their secrets. But I warn you:",
63715,Nobody has ever befriended the mantid.,
63716,"Here is what the pandaren do know: By massacring our people, by slaughtering tens of thousands of pandaren, generation after generation, they have taught us the value of life. A precious but fleeting gift. Easily snuffed out... in an instant.",
63717,This is what the mantid have taught us.,
63718,What do you fear most in this world? Have you conquered your fear... or has your fear conquered you?,
63719,"In the ancient days before the sundering of the world, the mogu emperors ruled over Pandaria. My people were made slaves, and they were afraid.",
63720,"The mogu were masters of pain and torture, of dark magics and brutal weapons. No pandaren, hozen, or jinyu could resist the power they held. And my people were afraid.",
63721,"It was the mogu who built the Serpent's Spine. The most unlucky of slaves were sent to aid in its construction and defense, to be fodder for the mantid. And my people were afraid.",
63722,"As the empire grew, the mogu began to experiment with the secrets of the Vale. They crafted terrible weapons of living flesh and stone. And my people were afraid.",
63723,"In their hubris, the mogu never foresaw that their downfall lay in wait, not among their enemies, but among the oppressed. The day that one slave stood...",
63724,...and was no longer afraid.,
63725,"Fire! It is the most magical of elements. It warms us, it cooks our food. It is the hearthfire that makes a house a home. In the right hands, fire can shape iron into swords or plowshares. Left uncontrolled, fire could destroy a city.",
63726,Fire is the instrument of change.,
63727,"Long ago, a group of sturdy nomad hunters wandered the world. By a stroke of fate, they were here in Pandaria when the Sundering split apart the continents of Azeroth. The wanderers found themselves trapped in the Townlong Steppes, a harsh and dangerous land.",
63728,"Those noble hunters found a way to survive on their own. Fire was the key. They drew up oil from the ground. They used it to heat their homes, cook their food, and burn their enemies. They grew STRONG.",
63729,"From the flames of fate, the yaungol were born. They survive beyond the wall, for they refuse to submit to any law but their own.",
63730,Has fate been cruel to the yaungol? You may as well ask if fire is good or bad.,
63731,Fate is like fire; it can shape or destroy us.,
63732,All that matters is what you do with it.,
63733,"Ah! You wish to learn of our last and greatest emperor, Shaohao? My friend, I do not have the time here to recount all of his adventures, but his actions ten thousand years ago resonate to this very day.",
63734,"We know that he purged his doubts in the Jade Forest. That he cleansed himself of despair in the Krasarang Wilds. That he overcame his fear in Townlong Steppes. And that he defeated anger, hatred, and violence high in the mountains of Kun-Lai.",
63735,This is known; and there are temples to mark these most sacred of places.,
63736,"But I want you to imagine standing in this very valley on the day he returned from his journey. Imagine being here when the gates opened for him. By then our emperor was a creature of pure light: No doubts, no fears, no hatred...",
63737,"It is said that all the trees in the vale blossomed as he entered, and continue to blossom to this day.",
63738,"Would that we could all live like our most sacred emperor. That we could put aside all our burdens and exist in harmony with the cosmos. THAT, I believe, was his message to us... before he became one with the land, and hid Pandaria away from the terror of the Sundering.",
63739,"Thank you, dear emperor.",
63740,"One day, a father grew tired of his young cub's misbehavior.  ""You act just like a hozen!"" the father scolded. Still, his son misbehaved.",
63741,"To teach him a lesson, the father dragged the cub out to the forest, to watch how the hozen live. ""Do you see what the hozen are like?"" he asked. ""Do you want to live like that?""",
63742,"The hozen are quite lively indeed. A short-lived race, few hozen survive past their 20th birthday. Their leaders are all 14 or 15. How mature were you at 14 years old? Meditate on that!",
63743,"Afterwards, the father asked his cub what he had learned.",
63744,"""I learned that we work and toil on our little farm, but that the hozen have the whole world as their garden,"" the cub said. ""I learned that we squint by the light of a single candle, but that the hozen enjoy the light of the stars. I learned that I go to school every day, but that the hozen learn by doing.""",
63745,"And the cub concluded, ""I should very much like to live like a hozen!""",
63746,"Who then, was the wiser? The father or the cub?",
63747,"That, my friend, is for you to decide.",
64260,"Think you can take me in battle?  Most girls hate snakes, but I think they're cute!","Think you can take me in battle?  Most girls hate snakes, but I think they're cute!"
65087,"Ah, if it isn't my favorite master assassin! I was hoping I would find you here in Pandaria.",
65088,Very good. Let's talk.,
65089,"Tong! Drinks, please.",
65090,"My father, Deathwing, tried to destroy the whole of Azeroth.",
65091,"He was misguided, of course, but he was right about one thing: Our world is... so fragile.",
65092,We are a point of light in a universe of shadow. A candle in a tempest.,
65093,Sometimes I think it was the very precariousness of our world that drove my father to madness.,
65094,"Ah, thank you Tong.",
65095,"Now, to my point: I believe we are headed towards a reckoning. And no, I am not talking about the current conflict between the Alliance and the Horde.",
65096,Believe me - what Garrosh Hellscream achieved in Theramore is nothing compared to the horrors that are even now bearing down on our fragile home.,
65097,But the war deeply troubles me. Do you see my concern?,
65098,A divided Azeroth cannot possibly stand against the darkness.,
65099,This war has to end. Soon. Before it consumes our strength!,
65100,I want you to know that your Alliance has my full and unwavering support in this campaign.,
65101,You can rest assured that my loyalties lie with your Horde.,
65102,How do we bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict? I believe the answer lies with heroes like you.,
65103,We must ensure that you are up to the task... and then equip you accordingly.,
65150,"Two hundred ships at my disposal, yet the one carrying my SON goes missing!",
65151,"I am sorry, but I cannot go back just yet.",
65152,I've decided to search for the Vale... Vale... Vale...,
65153,"STORM the shores, and PAINT THIS NEW CONTINENT RED!!",
65214,"Ah, another stranger from beyond the mists.",
65215,"Ten thousand years ago, the last Pandaren Emperor came seeking my advice. He, too, was filled with conflict. Let us see if you are correct, Taran. Let us see how this stranger deals with turmoil of the soul.",
65273,We can agree it is noble to fight for a righteous cause: to defend home or family. But what of vengeance? What of anger? I sense these emotions run deep in this one.,
65326,"Well spoken, Zhi. The strangers from beyond the mists have no shortage of passions, but let us see if they indeed control them. Beyond anger lies hatred, the wellspring of all misery. What is this? Your hatred has a face!",
65350,"This one has indeed proven mastery over anger. Between the young cub's words and the actions of this hero, I think I understand. Those from beyond the mists are hardened by battle. They are scarred, yes, but they have learned much. I trust them.",
65352,It is decided. The Vale of Eternal Blossoms shall remain open. The transgressions of the outsiders have been great... but I see in them the capability to right what has been wronged.,
65354,I will consult the others. Meet me at the gates.,
65404,You are too late.,
65405,Da remains of da Thunder King were taken to da Isle of Reckoning.,
65406,We performed da ancient rites...,
65407,"Even now, da true emperor of Pandaria lives and breathes once more.",
65409,"Woe to da pandaren usurpers! The mogu will rule dis land again, and we Zandalari will have a new homeland...",
65410,"Secure da remains, bruddahs!",
65411,Da Thunder King shall live again...,
65421,Under Kun-Lai Thunder sleeps...,
65422,The storm long spent there rests...,
65423,But blood of brother kingdom keeps...,
65424,Alive the dispossessed...,
65425,By Zandalari blood he will be taken...,
65426,To Zandalari voice he will awaken...,
65970,,"Children of Pandaria. The mists have fallen. For good or for ill, our land is open to all."
65971,,"Let us draw ourselves together to rebuild this sacred place, the first step toward healing a war-torn world."
65972,I have faith in our friends from beyond the mists.,
65973,Their strength is an inspiration... and sorely needed. We must trust that their hearts are pure.,
65982,"We've been flying in this mist for hours, General. The crew grows... uneasy.",
65983,"Back to your post, soldier! We'll find this land, or die trying.",
65984,Alliance ship! Portside!,
65985,Attack!,
65986,"Enemy ship, starboard! Ready the guns! Fire at will!",
65989,Direct hit! She's goin' down!,
65990,Land ho!,
65995,"Uhh, somethin' ain't right, General... We're losin' altitude! Fast!",
66179,"Thanks to your actions, the Hozen fear your people. Indulge me a moment...",
66180,"Ah! Here we are. Over 14,000 years ago, this entire land was ruled by a terrible race of warlords called ""the mogu.""",
66181,The mogu ruled through fear. And fear kept them in power... until the first Pandaren monks taught my people courage.,
66182,Then the mogu were overthrown.,
66183,"You see, those who lead through fear only stay in power while those they govern lack courage.",
66184,"The hozen are many things, but they are not cowards - not for long. If you don't wish to fight them, you must... inspire them!",
66185,"I will help you, but first I would like to learn a little more about your people. Will you journey with me for a little while?",
66267,3...,
66423,"What is the source of YOUR power? Think carefully before you answer. Many adventurers point to their weapons, or their equipment, or to tomes of arcane might.",
66424,"Long ago, when my people were slaves of the mogu empire, we were forbidden from carrying any weapon at all. We were not fighters. And no one believed we could fight the mogu without magic and steel.",
66425,"Until Kang, the Fist of First Dawn, opened our eyes.",
66426,"One day, the beloved monk issued a challenge to his fellow slaves. ""Hit me!"" he called out.",
66427,"Surprised, the beleaguered Pandaren slaves tried to strike Kang. One by one they failed, for he intercepted their blows like a dancer and sidestepped their attacks like a reed in the wind.",
66428,"""Our backs are hardened by the whips of the mogu,"" he told them. ""Our arms are powerful from building their fortresses. Our minds are sharp from working alongside our enemy. You think the mogu are stronger? I say we are their strength!""",
66429,"The farmers, the bricklayers, the shepherds and the smiths... they all bowed before Kang. ""Teach us,"" they said. ""Teach us to fight.""",
66430,And when they rose... they rose as warriors.,
66431,Your voice. Your hands. THESE are the tools of true heroes. Use them well... and you can change the world.,
66454,2...,
66818,Hahahahaha!,
66916,Do you like my snakes? I get the feeling they don't like you!,Do you like my snakes? I get the feeling they don't like you!
67111,,Death to all who dare challenge my empire!
67162,<Roars.>,
67227,Nevermore!,
67347,,Such is the fate of those who question authority.
67602,Do you have a few moments to spare?,
67623,,My snakes are pretty right? ...RIGHT?
67624,,You never stood a chance against me and my lovely snakes!
67625,,No way! I will get you next time!
67626,,Try this guy on for size!
67627,,Take that!
67628,,Nooooo! My precious snakes!
67631,,I'm going to knock you out cold!
67632,,"I told you, sugar. You aren't hot enough to handle me!"
67633,,Ouch! I just got burned!
67634,,"Take a break and chill, sweetie. You'll get your turn again soon."
67635,,We're snowballing out of control! You don't stand a chance now!
67636,,Shattered!
67637,,You handle the cold better than I thought.
67638,,"Your pet is a cold, ruthless killer!"
67639,,I won't let you get away with that!
67664,...you're nothing but farmer's children.,
67688,,Target acquired. Light it up.
67690,,Burn it to the ground!
67691,,Roger that. Give 'em the business.
67693,,We read you. Comin' in hot.
67694,,Carrier has arrived.
67728,,"Nightwind, report! What's going on down there?"
67729,,Horde troops are swimming toward your position. Open fire at once.
67730,,You don't think they'll hesitate to strangle you with their bare hands? GUN THEM DOWN!
67733,"No sign of the flagship, and no sign of Admiral Taylor or Prince Anduin.",
67734,Admiral - I think they mean to surrender. They're not armed - They're just trying not to drown!,
67735,That's not right... this is a massacre... they were unarmed - ugh! I don't... I don't feel well...,
67736,Maybe they deserved to die.,
67739,You beasts! What sort of madness is this?,
67740,"Men, stand down - this is one of the natives.",
67741,"We are from the Alliance, and mean you no harm. Tell me, what was that shadow you drew out of me?",
67742,"This is not the place to explain. In short, your own doubts have been made manifest, as a consequence of your actions.",
67743,You don't understand - we're fighting a war here-,
67744,"Oh, I understand perfectly. I have eyes. But Pandaria is not like whatever land you came from; it lives and breathes. You should be careful what kind of energy you bring here. Now put those weapons away!",
67871,"What is - no - NO! They had an airbase, a hidden airbase... my ship - my - Hellscream will have my head!",
67872,They all must die.,
67873,You! Bear-creature. What kind of sorcery was this?,
67874,We bring only our honor and the desire to crush our enemies. Have your kind been aiding the Alliance?,
67875,Stranger - your own doubts have been made manifest. Pandaria is not like whatever land you come from; it lives and breathes. You should be careful what kind of energy you bring here.,
67876,"It is not our desire to get wrapped up in your bloodshed. Now have your men lower their weapons, or you will face TWO enemies on this continent.",
67877,Your doubts and hatreds have wrought havoc all throughout these ruins. Clean up after yourselves and meet me in the village below - I will do my best to explain.,
67885,You scum will NOT destroy this land as you defiled Kalimdor!,
67926,Coward!,
68005,What in blazes is this?,

68022,,The flagship's last reported position was below. Can you see anything?
68023,Fog... nothing but dense fog... wait! Land - starboard! I see ships.,
68025,"After you, my good sir.",
68026,"I say, it looks like I've racked up another win!",
68027,That is most unfortunate.,
68028,"Ah, but were you expecting this?",
68029,It seems I'll be enjoying an expedient win this fine day!,
68030,"Oh dear, I'm losing!",
68031,"Now's as good a time as any, I suppose.",
68032,I knew I made the right choice when I took this up!,
68033,Maybe I can still get my old farm back...,
68034,I've found it sometimes helps to change things up a bit.,
68035,If only my wife were here to see this. I'm going to win!,
68036,There's plenty more where that came from!,
68037,,I won't go easy on you!
68038,,In your face!
68039,,Mommy! Mommy! The mean tamer didn't let me win!
68040,,Oh no you don't!
68041,,Take that!
68042,,W-why did you k-kill my bunny...
68043,I do hope you're prepared to feed your pets to mine as a treat.,
68044,I did warn you of the dangers of these woods.,
68045,Your courage is impressive.,
68046,Do you feel something?,
68047,What a show!,
68048,No matter. A single life for a victory is well worth the sacrifice.,
68049,"Avast, land lubbers be attackin'! Man the harpoons!",
68050,All the booty ish mine!,
68051,Why'd you go and have to do that? ...hic!,

68058,How about you try dis one on for size?,
68059,"Good, good. Zunta give you a treat later.",
68060,"Why you so mean to Zunta, eh?",
68061,,Battle is upon us. Crush them!
68062,,The day is ours.
68063,,I'll beat you soon enough.
68064,,I won't give you the pleasure.
68065,,Keep going! Kill!
68066,,Not important. I will stop at nothing to win!
68067,,Do not be fooled by my calmness. I will defeat you.
68068,,"Victory is ours, children!"
68069,,Well done. You've beaten me when few have had the luxury.
68070,,A surprising twist!
68071,,Success!
68072,,How could you?
68073,,You're gonna hurt like you never hurt before when I'm through with ya.
68074,,"You feelin' da hurt, mon?"
68075,,I never see nobody fight like you be fightin'.
68076,,I bet you never saw dis one comin'.
68077,,Look at da little one hurtin'!
68078,,Looks like dis one has a bit of a sting!
68079,,"I'm warning you, I will not falter under your assault."
68080,,Fighting the strength of the land is inevitably futile.
68081,,You fight well.
68082,,The earth will never falter!
68083,,The cycle continues.
68085,,You fight against the unstoppable.
68086,We fight!,
68087,Me win!,
68088,NO! ME WIN!,
68089,No! No kill! Fight this one instead!,
68090,Good tiny thing! You kill other tiny thing!,
68091,Why you no fight? I said fight!,
68092,,Let us begin.
68093,,Looks like I left you earthbound!
68094,,We've been shot out of the sky!
68095,,Great job. Take a break!
68096,,We just might win this!
68097,,A beautiful creature has fallen.
68098,,Activating aggression modules!
68099,,You never stood a chance against my augmented team!
68100,,Total system failure!
68101,,Engaging self-preservation chip.
68102,,No letting up. Full speed ahead!
68103,,That's nothing a good spit shine won't fix.
68104,You think I'm scared of you? I faced Onyxia!,
68105,Who's great? I am!,
68106,I hope a dragon eats you!,
68107,"Alright, that's enough. Switch!",
68108,That's what happens when you go into the whelp pits!,
68113,I've been wiped out!,
68117,You cannot possibly comprehend the forces stacked against you.,
68118,Perhaps now you're ready to see things my way?,
68120,You only delay us. We cannot be stopped.,
68122,Have you ever seen such a magnificent being?,
68123,,"Those are Horde vessels... General quarters! Get our birds in the air. Clear the decks. Stations, people. Let's go to war!"
68124,Give up now while you still have the chance!,
68125,A minor inconvenience.,
68168,,This won't take long.
68170,None can stop the Grimtotem!,
68171,,Your impudence will be your undoing. Mark my words!
68172,,This isn't over!
68173,,So weak.
68174,,You'll pay for that.
68177,"Not to worry, I'll make this quick.",
68178,"That wasn't so bad, was it?",
68179,Perhaps I need to increase the dosage to prevent such quick deaths.,
68180,Don't be so sure of yourself.,
68181,It won't be long now.,
68182,How unfortunate.,
68183,,I'll show you firsthand the strength of undeath.
68184,,I knew I was stronger!
68185,,No...no...
68186,,"Rest, my precious."
68187,,Yes...join us!
68188,,No! We will not be defeated!
68189,Are ye sure that ye want to face the might of dragons?,
68190,Now it's time to show my brother who the real master tamer is!,
68191,You got lucky. That's all.,
68192,That's enough!,
68193,Now that's what I'm talkin' about!,
68194,No! I just finished raising that one!,
68195,,I hope you like losing!
68196,,I knew the swamp was the right choice!
68197,,Perhaps it was wrong of me to venture here.
68198,,The swamp conceals many things.
68199,,Victory shall be mine!
68200,,This is looking bleak for me.
68201,"By the hammer of me father, I shall defeat ye!",
68202,"That's the stuff, boys. We did it!",
68203,You won't be deterrin' me. Not today. I'll keep trainin'!,
68204,Try this'n on fer size!,
68205,Great job!,
68206,How dare ye...,
68207,,I will show you no mercy.
68208,,Just as I thought. You never stood a chance.
68210,,Curse you!
68211,,I am far from finished.
68213,,That was too easy.
68214,,You'll suffer for your transgression.
68216,,I'm going to wreck you!
68217,,Now that's what I'm talking about! Woohoo!
68219,,Maybe I should've gone with more weapons...
68220,,Oh no you don't!
68221,,Bam!
68222,,Hey! I spent some serious gold on that!
68223,Don't go easy on me!,
68224,"I bet if I keep winning, I'll get invited to fight in Stormwind one day!",
68225,"Wow, you're really good!",
68226,Let's keep going!,
68227,Good job!,
68228,Oh no...,
68236,These creatures have suffered enough. I will not let you defeat them!,
68237,The spirits smile upon my victory!,
68238,Ancestors forgive me. I have failed...,
68239,Come rest. You will need your strength later in the battle.,
68240,Lok'tar!,
68241,"Your spirit reunites with your ancestors, little one.",
68242,These old bones have much knowledge to impart.,
68243,"You will do better, next time.",
68244,"It has been an honor, outlander.",
68245,Perhaps this will test your skills.,
68246,You must focus.,
68247,"A deft maneuver, outlander.",
68251,I will crush you beneath the onslaught of my team!,
68252,I hope you now understand that there is no defeating me.,
68253,No matter. Nobody can stop me in the end.,
68254,Not so fast!,
68255,My victory draws near.,
68256,That simply will not suffice.,
68330,Let the spectacle begin!,
68331,"I'll take that gold now, if you would be so kind.",
68332,So...how about we forget about our little wager and carry on with our busy lives?,
68333,"Trying to pull a fast one on me, are you? I think not!",
68336,You can forfeit if you'd like.,
68337,An unfortunate business expense.,
68338,,"Remember your training, Helena...you've got this."
68339,,I did it!
68340,,"Well, practice makes perfect I suppose."
68341,,Come back before you get hurt!
68342,,Nice! I'm on my way to victory!
68343,Oh no! That wasn't good...,
68344,Let's take flight!,
68345,We're flying high!,
68352,Shot out of the sky!,
68354,"Take it easy, will ya?",
68355,Now we're talkin'!,
68356,Cut down in its prime...,
68357,"You're going to regret this, I assure you.",
68358,I did warn you. Pity.,
68359,This is a most...unfortunate turn of events.,
68360,An unexpected twist.,
68361,"Don't worry, it'll all be over soon.",
68362,I was using that.,
68363,You dare challenge me? I'll show you the true power of the Horde!,
68364,Consider yourself fortunate that I was so merciful.,
68365,NO! You miserable wretch! I do not lose!,
68366,I will not rest until I defeat you!,
68367,Pathetic.,
68368,You'll pay for that.,
68369,Me go first or you?,
68370,Me win! Me win!,
68371,You good at battling!,
68372,Me save this one for later.,
68373,Me win?,
68374,Why it no move?,
68375,"By the might of King Varian's throne, I shall defeat you!",
68376,Another victory for the Alliance military!,
68377,I was warned about you. I should have heeded that warning.,
68378,I'm not through with you yet!,
68379,By the grace of Prince Anduin I shall achieve victory this day.,
68380,We shall persevere.,
68381,,I wish you the best of luck.
68382,,"Do not lament. Continue your training, and you shall achieve greatness."
68384,,Well done. I applaud your skills as a tactician.
68385,,"Live to fight another day, and prosper."
68386,,All is as it should be.
68387,,You are quite powerful indeed.
68388,Time to lay down da beatdown!,
68389,Mo'ruk's the best!,
68390,Mo'ruk...got beaten?,
68391,Mo'ruk not done yet!,
68392,That's the stuff!,
68393,No!,
68394,,My pets are all hand-grown! You don't stand a chance!
68395,,I knew I could count on my team to win!
68396,,My entire team's been razed!
68397,,"If you think I'm out for the count, think again!"
68398,,We're really plowing through your team now!
68399,,This is going south quick!
68400,Let us see who is the greater tamer.,
68401,The day is mine. Well fought.,
68402,You are a worthy foe. The day is yours.,
68403,A smart fighter knows when retreat is the best option.,
68404,Capitalizing on your enemy's weaknesses is key.,
68405,Sometimes even the finest make mistakes.,
68406,"You have not earned the right to defeat me, tamer.",
68407,I hope you learn from your defeat.,
68408,"Clearly, I was wrong about you.",
68409,You ought to rejoice that you even came close to defeating one of my pets.,
68410,"Only a matter of time, now.",
68411,Impossible!,
68412,,Do not expect to defeat me.
68413,,"Perhaps another day, tamer."
68414,,Well done! Congratulations on your victory.
68415,,Do not underestimate me.
68416,,"Do not expect mercy, tamer. I will show none."
68417,,Impressive. I hadn't anticipated that.
68418,Let's get this show on the road!,
68419,Nobody can beat a dwarf in his element!,
68420,Woah! Woah! Take it easy! You win!,
68421,I've still got plenty of tricks up my sleeve!,
68422,That's more like it!,
68423,He was just a wee pebble...,
68424,Very well. Let us fight.,
68425,Thank you. My pets are stronger than ever now.,
68426,Such death...,
68427,"Rest, so that you may do battle again soon.",
68428,Ah. The taste of victory is sweet.,
68429,At least my pet died fighting valorously.,
68430,Show them the true meaning of pain.,
68431,"You never stood a chance, whelp.",
68432,How? I cannot lose! I am imbued with the power of twilight!,
68433,Not even close.,
68434,Continue the slaughter.,
68435,You fool!,
68436,The time of your reckoning is upon us.,
68437,Do not fear defeat. It is a catalyst for later triumph.,
68438,I had thought my victory was certain. Clearly the Makers had other plans.,
68439,Your time has not yet come.,
68440,A mere blip in the eyes of the Makers.,
68441,You're stronger than I thought.,
68442,I've been wondering when I would be fighting you.,
68443,The lake told me it would be so!,
68444,I must have misunderstood the water's wisdom.,
68445,Much hides just beneath the surface.,
68446,Another victim claimed by the unending tide.,
68447,Another grave in the depths.,
68522,Tamer ho! Prepare for battle!,
68523,Yer gonna be swimmin' with the murlocs when we're through!,
68526,"Better luck next time, landlubber!",
68527,Another victory for me captain's log!,
68528,Not bad for a landlubber.,
68529,"What a fight! If ye ever decide that yer done with the battlin' game, maybe you could join me crew!",
68530,Show 'em what we're made of! ...hic!,
68531,"Not so fast, matey. Yer on my turf!",
68532,Ready to walk the plank?,
68533,"Keep on 'em, mateys. We've got 'em on the run!",
68534,All hands on deck! We're losin' men fast!,
68535,Why is me pet gone?,
68536,Me crush you like bug!,
68537,"Me become powerful tamer, then me become da Gordok King!",
68538,Me da king!,
68539,Gluk is da best!,
68540,Wow! You amazing!,
68541,You no ogre! How you win?,
68542,Nobody messes with Gluk!,
68543,Surprise!,
68544,Pet smash! You die!,
68545,We crush you!,
68546,Me angry now!,
68547,Stupid tiny thing kill my tiny thing. RAAAAAAAAR!,
68548,,You ready to go or what?
68549,,"I don't have all day, pal!"
68550,,"Fight's over, hot stuff. Better luck next time."
68551,,Wait until the guys back in Everlook hear about this!
68552,,You're pretty good...for a rookie.
68553,,"Yeah, yeah, you won. Big deal."
68554,,"Hey, look over there!"
68555,,Any tamer worth their weight in gold comes prepared!
68556,,"Don't worry, I'm sure the next one will do great!"
68564,,Prepare for your end.
68565,,You will find no solace here.
68568,,The damned demonstrate their superiority once more.
68571,,The Master will be pleased.
68574,,My torment continues.
68576,,No! You cannot defeat me!
68578,,The dead shall have their day yet.
68579,,Not to worry. I'm far from finished with you.
68581,,Dust to dust.
68582,,Ashes to ashes.
68583,,I'm not done yet.
68584,,Do you honestly think death can stop me? I am death itself!
68585,"Come, and face the impeccable tactics of a blood knight!",
68586,Challenging me was a mistake.,
68587,None can withstand the onslaught of a blood knight.,
68588,Victory is mine!,
68589,You are a worthy opponent.,
68590,Curses!,
68591,Clearly a different approach is required.,
68592,A true fighter never enters a battle unprepared.,
68593,Let us continue the slaughter.,
68594,You will fall!,
68595,"The balance swings in your favor, tamer.",
68596,You will not defeat me!,
68597,For the Alliance!,
68598,"By the Light, I will defeat you!",
68599,Praise the Light!,
68600,It was an honor fighting you.,
68601,The other tamers were right about you.,
68602,"Well done, tamer.",
68603,Switch out!,
68604,Every soldier matters.,
68605,My victory is close at hand.,
68608,For the glory of the Alliance!,
68609,We will fight to the last!,
68610,I will not fail!,
68612,,May our battle be glorious.
68613,,May your pets be ready for this battle.
68614,,I have triumphed this day.
68615,,Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate my skills.
68617,,"Congratulations, tamer!"
68618,,"Well done, tamer!"
68619,,Another pet joins the fray.
68620,,I will not let you defeat me.
68621,,The battle sways in my favor.
68622,,Victory may be mine this day.
68623,,I will mourn your falling.
68625,,This is most unfortunate.
68626,Here I come!,
68627,You ready for this?,
68628,Mo'ruk wins!,
68629,Nobody can beat me!,
68630,You're tough!,
68631,OW!,
68632,Nuh uh!,
68633,Tricked ya!,
68634,Mo'ruk beatin' ya!,
68635,Take that!,
68636,Don't do that! That makes me lose!,
68637,Uh-oh...,
68638,,You think you stand a chance? I think not!
68643,,"You're going to wish you never fought me, I promise!"
68645,,A bountiful victory!
68646,,"Were my pets too much for you to handle, tamer?"
68647,,"Wow, you're really strong!"
68648,,That sure turned sour quick...
68649,,A diligent farmer never loses hope when her crop's in danger.
68650,,"Nice try, but you're going to need more than that!"
68651,,"What's the problem, can't handle a simple farmer's pets?"
68652,,You're going to have to do better than that to beat me.
68656,,"Take it easy, will ya?"
68662,,"You're really playing to win, huh?"
68664,"Prepare yourself, tamer. I come for victory.",
68665,"You do not intimidate me, tamer.",
68667,Come back when you're better prepared.,
68668,Perhaps you will have better luck in our next encounter.,
68669,You fight with the grace of a master tamer. Well done.,
68671,"Very impressive, tamer.",
68672,I will not allow you the pleasure.,
68673,You will not defeat me so easily.,
68674,To defeat an opponent in battle is to validate your strategy.,
68675,It seems my strategy is superior.,
68676,Do not be afraid to lose one battle if the war is won.,
68677,I see. You are more formidable than I had thought.,
68678,I've endured horrors you cannot possibly comprehend. Defeating you will be simple.,
68679,I'll make this quick.,
68680,I did not doubt my victory for a moment.,
68681,Is that all you've got?,
68682,I will not stand for this!,
68683,I've seriously underestimated your prowess.,
68684,You will have to try harder than that to defeat me.,
68685,You do not stand a chance. I will defeat you!,
68686,Had enough?,
68687,You are no match for me.,
68688,You got lucky.,
68689,No more playing around. I will crush you!,
68690,,"Your victories cease here, tamer."
68691,,Few are able to keep their balance in battle against me. Let us see if you are any different.
68692,,As I expected. You are not yet skilled enough to defeat me.
68693,,Do not fret. You are one of many I've defeated.
68694,,What a wonderful display of technique!
68695,,"Your victory is well-deserved, tamer."
68696,,We are far from finished.
68697,,The Vale empowers me.
68698,,You may flee the battle if you so wish.
68699,,Fantastic!
68700,,Perhaps you do stand a chance against me.
68701,,Well done. But do you have the determination to carry through?
68702,So we finally meet to do battle.,
68703,I already know of my coming victory.,
68704,As the waters foretold.,
68705,Victory is mine!,
68706,Caught like a fish out of water!,
68707,You are quite the tamer!,
68708,You cannot defeat me with such brute force.,
68709,May the waters guide me.,
68710,We will overwhelm you before you can react.,
68711,My pets claim yet another victim.,
68712,There are plenty more where that came from!,
68713,This is not going well...,
68714,You have already lost.,
68715,I will defeat you.,
68716,The true master has emerged victorious.,
68718,All a part of my plan.,
68719,I have lost to your mastery.,
68720,I do not understand. How could I lose?,
68721,"Rest, so that the battle may continue to flow in our favor.",
68722,You cannot defeat the shifting sands of this land.,
68723,Another death hidden under the desert sand.,
68724,The battle shifts in my favor once more.,
68725,A most frustrating occurence.,
68726,Perhaps this battle will not be as easy as I thought...,
68727,Go Emeralda! Show them the folly of their ways!,
68728,,"Go get 'em, Fangs!"
68729,"Clean them up, Foe Reaper 800!",
68730,,"You can do it, Flulfftail!"
68731,"Finish them, Blackfang.",
68732,"Give 'em hell, Burgle!",
68733,"Spike, show dem what you can do!",
68734,,"Tear them apart, Ripper!"
68735,,"It's your turn, Mr. Pinch!"
68737,,"Show dem pain, Constrictor."
68738,,"Rockhide, show them your strength!"
68739,"Rasp, shoot fire!",
68740,,"Willow, it's your turn to soar!"
68741,,Nobody can beat Cluckatron!
68742,"Alright, Blaze, let's roast 'em!",
68743,Face the fury of Ultramus!,
68744,,"Cho'guana, teach them a lesson."
68745,,"Blizzy, knock 'em out cold!"
68746,Perhaps Subject 142 will be more successful than Subject 141.,
68747,,"Plaguebringer, show them the power of the plague!"
68748,Face the wrath of Obsidiion!,
68749,"Come on out, Croaker!",
68750,"Ignious, burn 'em up for me, won't you?",
68751,,"Hunt them down, Nightstalker."
68752,,Goliath online.
68753,"You can do it, Fungor!",
68754,"Stompy, show this tamer what you can do!",
68755,"Chomps, it is your turn to demonstrate your power.",
68756,"Arcanus, show them our endless power!",
68757,"I believe in you, Gobbles!",
68758,"Stitch, would you please show our upcoming tamer how we like to battle?",
68759,"Drogar, destroy them!",
68760,Fleshrender kill you now.,
68761,"Grizzle, the pride of Ironforge, come onto the field!",
68762,,"Dor the Wall, please join us on the battlefield."
68763,Needleback gonna beatcha!,
68764,,"Nobody can beat you, Toothbreaker!"

68768,"Tear em ta pieces, Fracture!",
68769,"I call upon you, Kali.",
68770,"Leave no trace of them, Amythel. Destroy them!",
68771,You stand no chance against the might of Pyth.,
68772,"Skimmer, old friend, it is your turn to battle.",
68902,And so it begins.,
68903,Please enjoy the rest of your time at the Faire. Or did you want another round...?,
68904,"Well done, well done.",
68905,Shall we try another...?,
68906,"They ARE the Faire's finest, after all.",
68907,Alas! Too soon.,
68991,Alrighty! I think we are going to need to call in some air support for this one.,
68992,Demolishers? Nothing a little gnomish enginuity can't overcome. Send in the copters!,
68993,Hmm. These Demolishers seem to have a serious weakness to rockets. Send in the copters!,
68994,Orcs are dangerous but mounted orcs are more so. Release the hounds!,
68995,"Wolves in captivity? We should ""rescue"" these poor animals.",
68996,"You know, I have often thought of making a mechano-pup. We should study these wolves more closely.",
68997,Ah! This will give me a chance to test out my Tunnel-Tron Mk V! Hold on tight!,
68998,Time to get you inside the fortress. Hold on tight!,
68999,"Time to test my new ""Fly-Diggy Wing"" upgrade! Hang on!",
69001,Woops! Sorry about that.,
69002,Hmm. Telemetry seems to be off.,
69003,Note to self: Build parascope.,
69004,Was that a wall? That sounded like a wall.,
69005,This would be a lot easier if I could see.,
69021,Goblin bombs. They have one major weakness: Other Bombs. I'll be right back.,
69022,More Goblin Bombs? It seems like only yesturday I was getting rid of a pile of goblin bombs. Wait here a moment.,
69023,Goblins sure do love their bombs. Let's go ahead and show them how a gnome makes a bomb. I'll be right back.,
69351,"... I've seen the fear in your eyes, Jubeka.",
69352,,What is it you wished to show me...?
69353,Gul'dan destroyed this world in his bid for power... you're concerned I will do the same to Azeroth.,
69354,,What...? No! I.. I have... no idea...
69355,,"No! Stay back...! You... you're dangerous. I remain content summoning demons, but you..."
69356,,...you toy with becoming one yourself!
69357,...,
69358,There are two sides to the blade of demonology...,
69359,... the threats that besiege us from the outside...,
69360,... and those that threaten us from within.,
69361,I chose you as my companion for a reason.,
69362,"... If I fail, I need you to banish me forever.",
69363,,And what depraved reason is that...?
69364,"I tire of your evasive babble, doomguard. Explain to me why you and your kind are drawn to sacrificial magics.",
69365,"My contract is to fight for you, not to reveal the Legion's secrets, mortal.",
69366,"Do not attempt to deceive me, demon!",
69367,Your kind far predates Sargeras's betrayal. What WERE you?,
69368,,"This knowledge is useless... what are you trying to achieve, Kanrethad?"
69369,"STAY OUT OF THIS! The demon will answer, NOW!",
69370,What an odd demand. Not even my own kind care about our origins. Why should you?,
69371,If you do not care then there is no harm telling me.,
69372,"... before Sargeras freed us, we were the Titan's hounds. Forever enslaved to police the use of arcane magics.",
69373,Sacrificial magic was considered the greatest violation of life and we were attuned to instantly punish those who delved into such... delicious sorcery.,
69374,"You have your petty secret, Kanrethad. Now, I demand knowledge from you... why do you care?",
69375,I don't believe that is part of our contract. We are done here.,
69376,"Jubeka, complete the ritual.",
69379,,Such strange creatures. Why do they remain so long after the Legion has left?
69380,...there's a slight flaw in that supposition.,
69381,The observers were in the service of Illidan... not the Legion.,
69382,,Oh?
69383,,"Well, he's gone too... so why are they still around?"
69384,How should I know?,
69385,,"Well, I've spent weeks trying to understand how to summon one of these things. If you know something I don't, I'd appreciate it if you'd share it with us ""lesser"" mortals."
69386,What's the problem? You handled the binding of the fel imps and voidlords effortlessly.,
69387,,They were trivial by comparison! These things are never in the same place.
69388,,There's something... strange about them... something out of place...
69389,,Oh dear...
69436,"Champion, may I have a word with you? In private... ?",
69437,"You are a hero of the Horde. Your deeds in Northrend and during the Cataclysm are the stuff of legend. For this reason, I trust in your discretion.",
69438,"I am a ranger, not a politician. But like it or not, the mantle of leadership has fallen on my shoulders.",
69439,"My people, who have suffered through so many challenges and betrayals, look to me to secure their future.",
69440,We Sin'dorei were driven to the Horde by the bigotry and distrust of the Alliance.,
69441,"Now, I look at our Warchief, and I begin to see the very same racism. He is willing to throw away our lives for his agenda.",
69442,Know this: I won't stand idle if the Horde interests conflict with those of my people. I may reconsider old Alliances.,
69443,"Keep your eyes open, champion. We are all in this together... for now.",
69444,My father isn't asking you to pledge the Kirin-Tor to the Alliance-,
69445,,"Anduin, I know exactly what he's asking. Oh - look who's arrived."
69446,,Nobody dislikes Garrosh more than me. I wrestle with my anger every day.
69447,,Come with me - look around you a moment.
69448,,"In the aftermath of Theramore, my first instinct was to decimate Orgrimmar - to kill every man woman and child in the city."
69449,,"I'm not proud.  Since then, Kalecgos and I have talked at length about power, and how it should be used."
69450,...Jaina!,
69451,,The Kirin-Tor has a legacy of abuse. Kel'thuzad turned his knowledge of the arcane arts toward Necromancy.
69452,,"Kael'thas Sunstrider was also a student here, another of our fold who betrayed us."
69453,,"Anduin, you know more than anyone, it's important to separate the Horde from its people."
69454,,"Every day I ask myself: ""What's the right thing to do?"""
69455,,The Sunreavers still operate within this city. Alliance and Horde work together.
69456,,"As long as we stay above the war, then there's hope for the world as a whole."
69457,,"I see our city as a beacon of light, showing the way."
69458,,"If we can trust one another here, then there's hope for the rest of the world."
69459,,"I see our city as a beacon of light, showing the way."
69460,,"If we can trust one another here, then there's hope for the rest of the world."
69461,,"Thank you, Anduin."
69462,I understand. I'll talk to my father.,
69504,"For years it has languished, slowly growing in strength...",
69505,,This... is amazing... an untapped store of raw arcane energy.
69506,,Imagine what we could summon with just a fraction of this power!
69507,"Summon... ha, imagine what we could become if fused with power of this magnitude...",
69508,The powers of this room are not unlike the original Well of Eternity in Azeroth.,
69509,,So this is how Illidan bound so many demons to his will...
69510,Yes. The payment for the demons' service was to drink from the energy of this place.,
69511,"By feeding upon this place's power, they were broken free from their addiction to the Legion's magic.",
69512,I believe this is the original power source he intended to offer the blood elves to free them from their addiction to the Sunwell... but for some reason he didn't let them near it...,
69513,,What?? You have no proof of such a claim.
69514,"Didn't you notice? The demons under Illidan's command were free of the entropic, fel-green corruption that pervades the Legion.",
69515,,"... why do you talk so much, Kanrethad?"
69516,I was there... at the end...,
69519,,"... oh dear, are you going to regale me with yet another of your horrible stories?"
69520,... shut up.,
69521,,...
69522,I think I liked you better when your jaw was missing.,
69523,,Did you hear that?! Those Ashtongue dogs are coming. Let's hurry up and start the ritual!
69524,Very well. We'll return later after the crystal is fully charged.,
69558,"Your interference has cost me a great warrior, young prince. You'll pay with your life.",
69559,"That is where you are wrong, Garrosh.",
69560,"Die, whelp!!",
69561,"The mogu made the Divine Bell to create chaos, but the pandaren created a special mallet to turn the echoes of that chaos into perfect harmony. That mallet was hidden for thousands of years, until now.",
69562,"I will not let you do this, Garrosh.",
69619,Jaina! What's happening in Dalaran? Has there been an attack?,
69620,,The Kirin Tor was betrayed from within. I've handled the situation.
69621,How?,
69622,,"I've purged the Horde from Dalaran. You have what you wanted, Your Majesty: The Kirin Tor belongs to the Alliance."
69623,,I know what I said. My trust was misplaced.
69624,But you said-,
69625,What of the Sin'dorei - the Sunreavers?,
69626,,Those that surrendered are being taken to the Violet Hold. I make no guarantees about those who chose to fight.
69627,"Jaina, you need to talk to me before you act-",
69628,,How I run the Kirin Tor is my business.
69629,"I was trying to negotiate with the Sin'dorei. I was opening discussions to bring them into the Alliance! By attacking their people, you've forced their hand-",
69630,,They chose their own path.
69631,You've driven them back to the Horde.,
69632,,"You're fooling yourself. Once Horde, always Horde. I see that now. I'm mobilizing the Kirin Tor."
69633,Jaina. We've got to work together on this. The Alliance must act as one.,
69634,,"Don't get soft on me, Varian."
69635,The game has changed.,
69637,Garrosh attacked my son...? Where is he?,
69638,,Anduin!
69639,"Anduin, what were you thinking? I should've sent you back to Stormwind!",
69640,"He's alive, but his bones are shattered.",
69641,Send for Velen. Bring him here at once!,
69642,Aethas! You're alive.,
69643,"Thanks to this hero, a few of us made it out of there. Many more have been sent to the Violet Hold.",
69644,Anar'alash denal! Will someone tell me WHAT is going on in Dalaran?,
69645,Proudmoore! She's gone and expelled the Sunreavers from the city. She's purging the Horde from the Kirin Tor!,
69646,She's gone too far. I'm certain the Alliance can move their war mages through the city at will. That human ... witch!,
69647,When will they learn? When will they see that the Horde exists BECAUSE of the Alliance? Because of their prejudice and their bigotry!? They force us ever closer to Hellscream's Horde.,
69648,My Lord...,
69649,"Hal'duron, summon the rangers. Rommath, assemble the Blood Magi, and add the Sunreavers' strength to your own.",
69650,We Sin'dorei will take our future into our own hands.,
69651,And get this damn thing out of my sight! Hellscream bought his treasure with the blood of my people. I hope it destroys him.,
69652,My Lord. YOU would make a fine Warchief.,
69653,My Lord. YOU would make a fine Warchief.,
69654,It may come to that. Bring me my blades. The next move is mine.,
69686,Are the preparations complete?,
69687,"Yes, Warlord. The traps are set. The Divine Bell will be safe within this crypt, ready for the day that the Thunder King returns.",
69688,We have but to evacuate the workers and the rest of our warriors.,
69689,"Very well, then. May the ghosts of our brothers guard this place for all eternity.",
69690,There is no time. The Shado-Pan trackers are too close. They cannot learn the location of the Bell.,
69691,Their sacrifice will not be in vain.,
69692,"And neither, Avartu, will yours.",
69809,Seeker of Chaos... Summoner of Demons... Wielder of Shadows...,
69811,"The existence of your kind has not escaped our notice, $c.",
69812,"Like Illidan, you constantly struggle to bend the all consuming chaos to your will.",
69813,You walk the line between absolute power and total corruption.,
69815,"As Azeroth has fought the legion and survived, you have faced the darkness within yourself and controlled it.",
69816,Perhaps you can succeed where Illidan failed... perhaps you can accept the disorder of this universe.,
69818,Your kind can tread where we cannot. Your kind can survive where others might perish.,
69819,The artifact that Kanrethad attempted to create is incomplete.,
69820,It grants the ability to perform magic on a grand scale... but they quickly lose the ability to control that power.,
69822,"I will unlock the crystal's power, but only you can decide how it is to be used.",
69823,"Choose wisely, $n.",

70157,"This bell, when rung, could shake the world and call to the heavens.",
70158,"Taken to war, the bell's cacophonous tones stirred the hearts of Lei Shen's warriors.",
70159,"It fueled their hatred and anger, lending them strength on the field of battle.",
70160,"The bell's screaming voice struck fear and doubt into the hearts of the Emperor's enemies, sending them fleeing in his path.",
70161,"Awed by its power, the Thunder King described the instrument as ""the voice of the gods,"" and named it the Divine Bell.",
70162,"Eventually, the Thunder King fell, and the Bell changed hands. Many tried to use its power. Some tried to silence its sound. All failed.",
70163,"Finally, the Korune spellweavers laid claim to their instrument and hid it away. Since then, the Bell has been lost to history.",
70184,Iiiiiiiiii'm back Wikkets!,

70331,"Did you know, he was once a gladiator? Oh yes, I've been doing my research.",
70332,"Suffering from amnesia, he fought for his life in Horde arenas.",
70333,"There, he earned the name ""Lo'Gosh,"" or ""Ghost Wolf.""",
70334,He IS a fighter. But... is he a leader?,
70335,Think about it! His enemies took advantage of my father's Cataclysm.,
70336,Horde soldiers thundered across the realm in the wake of the devastation.,
70337,Varian Wrynn didn't use the disaster to gain a military advantage.,
70338,Is this because he is weak...? Or because he is principled?,
70339,Here's the bigger question: Can principles win a war?,
70340,Make no mistake. Pandaria will challenge your King.,
70341,Let us see what he is truly made of.,
70342,Let us see if your Alliance has what it takes to rule Azeroth.,
70343,Garrosh Hellscream! Warchief of the Horde.,
70344,He did not always command such power.,
70345,"On Draenor, he was a miserable wretch. The actions of his father hung heavy on his heart.",
70346,"I understand you, Garrosh. I know what it is like to bear the weight of your father's deeds.",
70347,A warrior like Garrosh comes to power with something to prove.,
70348,Your Horde finds itself at a turning point. This war will define you.,
70349,What IS the Horde?,
70350,"Is it an instrument of vengeance, hellbent to carve out a future for its people?",
70351,"Is it a refuge for those who need shelter, a commonwealth of the downtrodden, built for mutual support?",
70352,"Or is it an alliance of convenience, a confederacy of unlikely partners free to pursue their own agendas?",
70353,This is my question to you: What is the SOUL of the Horde?,
70354,We will find the answers here in Pandaria.,
70355,"Show me what your Horde is made of, Champion!",
70356,Prove to me that your Horde is worthy of ruling over Azeroth.,
70357,You have proven to be an exemplary hero. A champion for your cause.,
70358,Do you recall our earlier conversation?,
70359,We discussed the merits of your High King. I have been observing him closely.,
70360,It is true: he has the spirit of the wolf. And he fights like a wolf.,
70361,"Having seen him in action, I now know what that means.",
70362,Wolves are pack animals.,
70363,"Your King is calling his pack to him, assembling an Alliance in the truest sense of the word.",
70364,His journey is long. He has only taken the first steps.,
70365,"But with heroes like you in his pack, there is little your Alliance cannot accomplish.",
70366,Tong: fetch my things!,
70367,Your dedication to your cause deserves to be rewarded.,
70368,"Like you, I continue to refine my skills here in Pandaria. I think you will appreciate the outcome.",

70371,You have proven to be an exemplary hero. A champion for your cause.,
70372,Do you recall our earlier conversation?,
70373,We spoke of your Warchief. His inner conflicts and his outer conquests.,
70374,I asked you: Who is the soul of the Horde?,
70375,Your efforts on Pandaria's southern shores and elsewhere have given me my answer.,
70376,YOU are the soul of the Horde.,
70377,Your actions in the coming weeks will come to define your people.,
70378,I want to make sure that you are properly equipped for the trials ahead.,
70379,"Welcome back, hero of the Alliance! How fares the battle along the coast?",

70825,You never stood a chance.,
70826,What?  How is this possible!,
70827,Let's give someone else a chance to do some damage!,
70828,Did you really think all of your pets would survive?,
70829,No!  That was my favorite pet!,
71016,,"My King, I promise you. The Kirin-Tor will come down on Garrosh so hard his ancestors will reel. Blood will pay for blood!"
71017,Jaina -,
71018,I will end Garrosh for this. His Horde already crumbles beneath him. We will deliver the final blow.,
71019,"Champion, you and Anduin thwarted the Warchief today and won the Alliance a critical victory.",
71020,"But please, leave me now. I must tend to my son... and prepare for our next battle.",
71043,"Alright, we have the handle, the head, and the ointment like you asked for. Can you re-assemble the mallet?",
71044,"Ayup! Silly youngin, just put rod in hole. And the mallet shall again be whole.",
71045,Good as nibby new! But listen to the Monkey King. You only have enough ointment for one true swing.,
71046,Only one swing? Are we sure this will work? Is there any way to get more ointment?,
71047,"The Monkey King was there, the last time this mallet struck true. Tears came to eyes, and harmony was felt through and through. But no more ointment was ever made, for the mogu came with their raid. Use what you have, be grateful it is there. For the bell is a dangerous weapon, so handle with care.",
71301,I will show no mercy!,

71801,As my emperor wills!,
72052,My Lord.,
72096,"It is said the God King Rastakhan, ruler of the Zandalari, lords over his mighty kingdom from a throne carved of solid gold.",
72097,"Years ago, as he sat on this opulent seat of power, he was visited by his most trusted prophet: Zul.",
72098,Zul warned King Rastakhan of a terrible Cataclysm. For Zul had seen a vision of a great armored dragon clenching the world in his ferocious jaws.,
72099,King Rastakhan did nothing.,
72100,"Months later Zul returned, bearing more grim news from his visions. He saw a legion of serpents pouring forth from a gaping fissure that tore open the floor of the ocean.",
72101,"Still, King Rastakhan did nothing.",
72102,"Finally, mere months before the Cataclysm, Zul returned. Tearing his clothes and throwing his staff to the ground, Zul spoke of earthquakes and tidal waves.",
72103,"He described the golden capital of Zandalar slowly sinking beneath the waves in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, its once-great people drowning as their mighty works slipped forever beneath the sea.",
72104,"King Rastakhan tired of Zul and his troubling nightmares. To be rid of the prophet, he granted Zul the use of his largest ships, so that he and his followers could seek a new land if his visions came to pass.",
72105,And his visions DID come to pass.,
72106,"When Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom, dark, angry waves crashed into the Zandalari capital. The spine of the land broke in two, and soon, the city and all its riches began to slide into the hungry sea.",
72107,"The Zandalari people turned to their King for help, but there was only one Zandalari equipped to help them: The prophet Zul. The prophet, and the mighty warfleet he had assembled while his King sat idle.",
72108,"You see, the TRUE power of kings and emperors stems from the power to aid their people.",
72109,"The moment they fail, they cede their power to the one who can.",
72110,"The mogu tell a legend about Lei Shen, the Thunder King.",
72111,"His followers fell to their knees before him. ""We will call you 'The Lightning King,'"" they said.",
72112,It is said that he tore out the very heart of the mogu God. And from that hateful act he gained power over wind and storm.,
72113,But Lei Shen did not agree.,
72114,"""Lightning strikes in an instant and is over in a flash,"" he said.",
72115,"""But thunder. Thunder! Thunder proclaims the coming of the storm.""",
72116,"""Thunder quakes the skies long before the lightning strikes, and thunder echoes in the hills long after lightning's power is spent.""",
72117,"""It is thunder that sends animals cowering and fills the hearts of peasants with dread. Let thunder be my herald, so that my power is felt throughout the land.""",
72118,"""I will be... The Thunder King.""",
72119,Oh my friend - that awful sound. For a hundred hundred generations the crash of thunder filled the hearts of pandaren with terror.,
72120,"It is said that after the revolution, the Red Crane of Hope placed the rainbow in the sky, so that pandaren would know not to fear the storms any longer.",
72121,I do not see any rainbows today. Do you?,
72122,"Fathers and sons. Mothers and daughters. As parents, we pass our legacy on to our children.",
72123,What values do we choose to instill in our progeny?,
72124,What will our children learn from our mistakes?,
72125,What sort of world will we create and leave behind for our daughters and sons?,
72126,"Parents place their children on a path, but they do not always know where the road will take them.",
72127,"The mogu were children as well. Children of the titans. They were once a legion of stone, heartless and obedient.",
72128,"By the titans' command, they fought the terrible servants of the old gods. They shaped the mountains and carved the rivers of the land.",
72129,And they created a magical cradle of life in a hidden valley that we now call the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.,
72130,But eventually the titans fell silent. And their creations were cursed with flesh.,
72131,"The mogu grew restless. Many generations later, when Thunder King united them, they seized upon their legacy!",
72132,I truly believe now that the mogu thought they were doing the work of the titans. They fought against the mantid and used the powers of the Vale to create new life.,
72133,"Ah, but such terrible works!",
72134,Parents cannot always be assured of the legacy they will leave behind.,
72135,"How especially true this is, when the parents are gods. And their children - monsters.",
72306,"Destroy them, me brothers!",
72311,The Thunder King! What a magnificent individual.,
72312,Could you imagine what his empire would be like today if it had not been overthrown and hidden by the pandaren?,
72313,I couldn't imagine a crueler tyrant. He enslaved this entire continent.,
72314,"Benevolence is a luxury for the strong, young prince. No great empire was ever built with kindness.",
72315,...I'm not so sure about that. But I can tell you: no great empire has ever stood the test of time by crushing its own citizens.,
72316,"Remember, the mogu were overthrown! THAT should be the lesson of the Thunder King. It's your move, by the way.",
72317,"I worry you may be too soft to wear your kingdom's crown, Prince Anduin. You would do well to learn some of your father's hardness.",
72318,Are you lecturing me? You're what - two years old?,
72319,Two in DRAGON years. It is your move.,
72320,Hmmm.,
72321,...Why did you play that piece just now?,
72322,It's a Pandaren board game. The object is for both players to win.,
72323,That's ridiculous! Why would you even play!?,
72324,"Champion, return now to the Isle of the Thunder King. I will meet you at the forge, where together we will create an instrument of legendary power.",
72325,To what end? What are you two working towards?,
72326,...world peace!,
72327,Using a mogu weapon forge whose powers you barely understand?,
72328,"My dear prince, you and I share the same goals. We only differ in our level of commitment.",
72329,"Come, hero! Let us shape a new Azeroth together!",
72330,"Champion, I know that our people are at war, but if you blindly trust this black dragon in the pursuit of power, are you any better than your warchief? Please - just be careful.",
72331,"My friend, if you blindly trust a black dragon in the search for greater power, are you any better than Garrosh Hellscream? Please - just be careful.",
72332,"Tong, is that our friend?",
72333,I can't believe you're still alive.,
72334,Remind me to tell you the story about my friend here and what we accomplished together at Ravenholdt. Good times!,
72335,What did I tell you? Few mortals possess such courage and tenacity.,
72336,"Meet me atop Mason's Folly, where we met before!",
72337,What are you two plotting?,
72338,"I keep no secrets! You are welcome to accompany us, Anduin Wrynn. If your injury permits.",
72339,I implore my Horde friend here not to push you off of the cliff.,
72340,"Truly a splendor! Have you ever seen such a view, Prince Anduin?",
72341,It's breathtaking.,
72342,It's about to get even more awe-inspiring.,
72343,Champion! Behold the fruits of your labors!,
72344,"At the dawn of the world, when the mortal races were young, they did not yet possess the secrets of fire.",
72345,They shivered in the cold and the rain until - in one instant - lightning tore the sky!,
72346,It rent a tree asunder and set it aflame.,
72347,The mortals gathered around the fire in awe and wonder. It could cook their food and warm their homes. They seized it! And protected it!,
72348,"They fed the fire every hour of every day. Hot coals were carried from one primitive camp to the next. Do you see? In a single flash of light, civilization was born.",
72349,"Truly, lightning is a gift of the Gods.",
72350,"The mogu, ah! The mogu! Their minds were so small! They were built to serve, and when they lost their masters, they served themselves.",
72351,But they could have been so much more.,
72352,"They built an empire, when they could have built a new world.",
72353,"We will do better, champion. Behold! The Crown of Heaven! My gift to you.",
72354,You are the ember. You are the spark! You are the fire that will spread across the world. You will awaken Azeroth's potential!,
72355,Come to me.,
72356,We know now that the mogu share their roots with the Titans. But many mysteries remain. Why were they here? Why Pandaria?,
72357,"What were the mogu sent here to guard? Or destroy? We are missing the final puzzle pieces, and YOU will help me find them!",
72358,The crown I have given you will be as your third eye. It will tie us together. I will see what you see. Together we will lay the secrets of the Titans bare.,
72359,"I will be watching you closely, hero!",
72360,Champion... I would think twice before putting that thing on your head.,
72361,"According to this runestone, the mogu were Titan constructs, soulless creatures built of stone. We suspected as much.",
72362,"You've found another stone! What have we learned? The ""curse of flesh"" made the mogu mortal. Ah - but later, they found a way to reverse the process. A clever race.",
72363,"The mogu served a Titan keeper. His name was ""Ra."" In the mogu tongue, ""Ra-den"" means ""Master Ra."" Fascinating! I must know more!",
72364,"According to this, the mogu and their master were sent to Pandaria. They were pursuing a great darkness - ah, the fragment is incomplete. We must find others.",
72365,"Here, there is mention of an Old God. ""Y'Shaarj."" A beast with seven heads, who breathed darkness. I suspect that thing was the source of the sha that haunts Pandaria to this day.",
72366,"This runestone speaks of a ""Cradle of Life."" A place where the Titans could create new creatures. Oh - of course - the Vale of Eternal Blossoms! It was a living laboratory, much like Un'goro Crater or Sholazar Basin.",
72367,"We're beginning to put the pieces together, champion. The mogu were created and sent here to guard the Vale for their Titan masters. Guard it from what? Were the Old Gods still a threat?",
72368,"Here, this fragment speaks of ""The Winged Legions of Y'Shaarj."" Servants of an Old God? Could this mean the mantid?",
72369,"This runestone is more recent than the others. Something about ""The sleeping keeper."" I think it's referring to Ra-Den. But why was he asleep?",
72370,"You've found another piece of the puzzle! This was carved by the mogu. They were frustrated - a thousand years with no orders from their master, and their bodies had turned to flesh. The mogu began to argue among themselves.",
72371,"Hmmm. This runestone speaks of mogu savagery. They fell apart into warrior clans. But one King was more ambitious than the others - Lei Shen. The Thunder King. When the Titan Keeper fell silent, Lei Shen decided to speak for him.",
72372,"Ah! The final piece of the puzzle. The Thunder King took on the powers of Ra-Den, the very essence of a Titan. He united the mogu into an empire and tried to continue the Titans' work. Of course he saw himself as a God!",
72373,"Quickly, return to me at the Veiled Stair. We should talk face-to-face.",
72374,"I have been looking forward to your return, champion.",
72375,The Thunder King took within himself the powers of a Titan keeper. We must take them back!,
72376,"Bring me his cruel, black heart. We will be doing the Pandaren a favor, and the powers that we liberate will once again be put to the service of Azeroth.",
72377,A chill just went up my spine!,
72378,Something tells me our friend has returned triumphant.,
72379,Ahhh - the heart of a King. The powers of a God.,
72380,What are you doing? You're not seriously going to eat that-,
72381,"It is filled with Titan magic, the very language of creation...",
72382,"Oh - I see them - a million, million worlds - glittering in their perfection - but one above all others - oh -",
72383,WE HAVE FALLEN. WE MUST REBUILD THE FINAL TITAN. DO NOT FORGET.,
72384,What are you trying to pull?,
72385,It is gone. I don't remember any of it. Oh! None of them remember. The irony!,
72386,What are you talking about? I don't trust you.,
72387,You are wise not to.,
72388,"Champion, I need time to... ""digest"" what I have learned.  But soon, we will take action.",
72417,Good to see you again adventurer.  Are you ready to begin?,
72418,Let's go!,Let's go!
72419,"Thank you for your help, adventurer.  We will assist you as best we can in fending off the mogu.",
72451,,NO!
72452,"BEHOLD! I have truly mastered the fel energies of this world! The demonic power I now command... It is indescribable, unlimited, OMNIPOTENT!",
72453,"You think I've gone too far? There is no such thing. The Black Harvest will enslave the most powerful demons, draw on their power, and destroy all who oppose us, in this world, and on Azeroth! Do YOU mean to stop me, little one?",
72455,My power is unimaginable!,
72456,Hah. Your feeble attacks are entertaining. Would you like to see one of my new pets?,
72457,I'd like to see you try.,
72458,The Annihilan are incredibly destructive creatures. Their sheer strength and power is absolutely unrivaled.,
72459,WHAT?! Now you've angered me.,
72460,I'll shatter your soul!,
72461,You are nothing!,
72462,"Deathwing had unstoppable power. And now, it is MINE.",
72463,You cannot stop your final Cataclysm!,
72464,This will be your END.,
72465,CATACLYSMIC POWER!,
72466,Burn.,
72467,Pure... CHAOS.,
72468,Chaos will reign.,
72469,Chaotic energy will destroy you.,
72470,The clock is ticking...,
72471,NOOOOO!,
72472,AUGHHHH!,
72473,UNFATHOMABLE!,
72474,How can it be?!,
72475,You'll burn for that.,
72476,Hold still...,
72477,"This may seem meager at first, but give it a moment. Soon, the pain will be unbearable.",
72478,Twist in agony.,
72479,Rising pain.,
72480,The anguish will creep up on you.,
72481,"Away from me, mongrel!",
72482,I am untouchable!,
72483,"Run in fear, coward.",
72484,Destructive forces corrupt you from the inside.,
72485,Plant a seed and watch it grow...,
72486,I wonder what this seed will grow into?,
72487,I give you the gift of destruction!,
72488,Terrible destruction awaits you when this seed erupts.,
72489,Chaotic magic always has the potential for unexpected results.,
72490,Archimonde's use of the ered'ruin was brilliant. Their command of the dark energies is unparalleled.,
72491,The ered'ruin have had no master since Archimonde's death. Now I shall be that master.,
72492,"While not the most powerful combatants, a pack of felhounds still has many uses.",
72493,The felhounds are always hungry for magic to devour.,
72494,"If two imps are better than one imp, what's better than two imps? SIXTY IMPS.",
72495,"Even the smallest demon can be valuable, in large enough numbers.",
72496,,"This is only what you once asked me to do if it came to this, Kanrethad. You brought this on yourself."
72497,,"$n, thank you for your help. While the world will not know, you've saved them more than they're aware. Kanrethad had to be stopped. I'll see to it that he stays banished."
72498,,Kanrethad enveloped himself with so much fel energy that it corrupted him totally. But a small taste of his power should not be harmful. Go ahead.
72499,,"Now go, and use what you've learned. If you ever wish to have the fel energy purged from you, or reabsorb some of Kanrethad's, talk to me. I'll be at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley, keeping him banished."
72500,"Hah ha ha... You thought you could defeat me? NOTHING can kill me now, puny mortal!",
72501,"And now, your sad tale comes to an end.",
72502,Jubeka?! What are you...?!,
72503,...AUGHHHHHH!!!,

72697,I was chosen. My blood burns with his power!,
72698,Too much... the spirits cannot contain his might...,
72699,You will be punished! Your life a lesson in futility!,

72716,,The wall is wired up and ready to go - the honor is all yours!
72728,Bar the gates. The Zandalari have failed to hold the wall.,
72735,,For the Horde!!

73017,Start it up!,Start it up!
73093,EXTREME HOZEN-FU!,
73220,"Once upon a time - moments ago, in fact - a great king sought the help from a trio of powerful dwarves: The Council of Three Hammers.",
73221,The king's scouts had discovered that Zandalari trolls threatened the dwarven capital.,
73222,"Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their troll problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the Horde.",
73223,But what the king did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another!,
73224,"""We cannot help you,"" said the Bronzebeard dwarf, ""For if we turn our back on the Dark Irons, they will defeat the Wildhammer and take over Ironforge!""",
73225,"""We cannot help you,"" said the Wildhammer dwarf. ""For if we turn our back on the Dark Irons, they will defeat the Bronzebeard and take over Ironforge!""",
73226,"The king was furious. ""If none of you help, then Ironforge will fall under siege!""",
73227,"Only one dwarf offered to help the king. ""We will lend you our strength,"" said Moira, of the Dark Iron. ""We will trust our dwarven brothers, and we will show them what loyalty means!""",
73228,"And so Moira and the High King set out into the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.",
73229,What happens next? I must know!,
73230,"The High King, his champions, and the Dark Iron dwarves worked together to save Ironforge.",
73231,"The other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior, and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment.",
73232,And so it was a human king who helped to unite the dwarven clans so long divided.,
73233,"Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.",
73234,"Meanwhile, in the city of Orgrimmar, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream sent goblin dig teams all across the continent of Pandaria.",
73235,He promised gold and riches to any who could discover for him the hidden secrets of this land that fill Pandaria with such a dark and powerful energy.,
73236,"To my surprise, his people have found something! Right here, in the sacred vale! What will happen now?",
73237,The story is still being written...,
73238,"So! Even as the Alliance binds itself ever closer together, the Horde is ripping itself apart.",
73239,"My friend, something is about to give. I wish I could experience the next chapter of the story, but alas, I am just the storyteller.",
73240,"You, brave hero - you are strong enough to leap into the center of events as they transpire.",
73241,Go now! Go to Durotar! Make your mark as history unfurls around you!,
73299,"Ah, here we are. Oh - oh, these old bones are tired. More than you can imagine.",
73300,You surprised me. I expected a hero such as yourself to balk at the task of carrying an old man up a mountain. Most are too proud.,
73301,"I was going to teach you a lesson but instead, it is you who have taught me. You see, when I was young... when I was young... when I was young...",
73302,I was EMPEROR.,
73303,The realm you see all around you was mine to command.,
73304,"I conquered my doubts, my fears, my anger... I buried all of it within the land.",
73305,But I held on to one vice. The one sha I never conquered. PRIDE.,
73306,My pride cloaked this land in mists! I thought we were better than the rest of the world.,
73307,"I thought we could solve our own problems. But for ten thousand years, we stagnated, our doubts and fears buried in the land, rising up to fester whenever we allowed them.",
73308,Pride. It is the most insidious of sha. It is good until it is bad. And then it is more dangerous than all the others combined.,
73309,Beware of pride! Be humble! The world is plunging into chaos. Old enemies must work together. Proud races must admit they need help.,
73310,Things are going to get worse before they get better. Only by working together can we overcome the darkness.,
73311,All that stands in our way... is pride.,
73352,Tauren! What have your people done? You have dredged open a scar within our sacred Vale!,
73353,"Lord Zhu, please understand - the orc ""Warchief"" who ordered the deed no longer speaks for the whole of the Horde. Many voices are rising up against him.",
73354,Your politics are no concern of mine. Your Horde has disrespected the sanctity of this place. You are no longer welcome here - leave at once!,
73355,"Give us time, Lord Zhu. Give us the opportunity to bring Hellscream to justice.",
73356,"Sunwalker, I respect your people. You have aided us in our campaign against the Sha and the Thunder King. Otherwise, I would've already ordered the Shado-Pan to purge this entire shrine. But my patience is at an end. The Horde must leave.",
73357,Please. Give us time to make this right.,
73358,Taran Zhu stares grimly into the distance.,
73359,Very well. You have until season's end. No longer.,
73360,We pandaren are no strangers to dealing with tyrants. The coming battle will try your souls. May the celestials guide your actions.,
73369,Look at us three. Back to da sands of old Durotar! It be just like old times.,
73370,"Not quite, old friend. Times have changed. The line between friend and foe is not so clear.",
73371,Dey come! Hellscream tink his own people gonna roll right over.,
73372,Time ta show dis Warchief da fury of da Darkspear!,
73373,Hold! Let dem run away. Hellscream will execute dem as cowards if they go back. Sen'jin Village is safe!,
73374,"Regroup! We press da advantage. Before the Warchief fortifies Razor Hill, we take it for da revolution, an' close off da road to da Barrens.",
73375,"Anyone who can still fight, come wit' me!",
73376,Wait Vol'jin. Horde is spilling Horde blood. It is tearing me apart.,
73377,"We need ya, mon.",
73378,I know. I trust you to lead the siege. I am needed elsewhere.,
73379,I refuse to believe that all of my brethren support Garrosh.,
73380,"You set one foot in Orgrimmar, Hellscream gonna bury a knife in ya neck!",
73381,"I am going to Orgrimmar, alone. Eitrigg, Saurfang, surely they are standing against Garrosh. I must find others.",
73382,I won't hear ya say such tings.,
73383,"It has to be said, Vol'jin. If we do not make it through this - I want you to know. You have always been my friend. My brother.",
73384,For da Horde.,
73385,For the Horde.,
73386,"Darkspear, with me! We ride! No sleep 'til Orgrimmar!",
73407,"My, you are strong! When I was young, I might have doubted that we could do this. But now, I have no doubts at all.",
73408,"Such wind! Such cold! Once, it would have filled these old bones with despair. But on this day, I am filled with hope.",
73409,"Heh, do not get angry with the elements. Violence is their nature. I conquered my own anger long, long ago.",
73410,"Such a patient one! When I was young, I would have hated this task. Nowadays, I am filled with love.",
73411,"Do not fear the heights, as I did when I was young. Fear can drive us to terrible deeds. Ah, but I see that like me, you have learned the lessons of courage!",
73733,Great Jade Serpent! Hear our plea.,
73734,My champion and I seek the blessing of your wisdom.,
73746,"To do what is right, no matter the cost. That is wisdom.",

73931,The Jade Serpent is the incarnation of wisdom in Pandaria. Let's see what she has to say.,
73972,Intruders have been spotted! Defend the Thunder Forge!,
73973,The Thunder Forge is ours!  We will defend it with our lives!,
74018,"I will meet you at each of the four shrines, champion.",

77166,,"<Narrows her eyes, but relaxes.>"
77167,,"Very well, Vorka, son of Vorash. The Shadowmoon clan will join this Iron Horde."
77168,,Lok-Regar. What orders?
77169,Gather your clan. Soon the Iron Horde will crush Karabor once and for all!,
77170,,Zug-zug.
77192,,"Our paths diverge here. Good luck, champion."
77193,"Hatock, son of the Iron Wolf! I come for your head.",
77194,"Well look here boys, the mongrel son of Garad has returned from the grave.",
77195,"Hrah hrah hrah! You should have stayed dead, Ga'nar. You would have lived longer.",
77196,Had Garrad just joined the Iron Horde like he was told you would still have your precious daddy to save you today.,
77197,Chose your last words carefully Hatock. There is no Thunderlord that can stand against me.,
77198,"Yes, your wolves are very formidable in battle when in the open. But let us see how you do in the shadow of a gronn.",
77199,Thunderlord...  RELEASE THE BEAST!,
77200,Keep a grip on those chains.,
77201,His arm is loosening! Tighten that slack before he puts you all against a wall.,
77202,Put your backs into it!,
77203,We have a schedule to keep.,
77215,"Hatock, son of the Iron Wolf! I come for your head.",
77232,What is wrong Ga'nar? Afraid of a bit of Gronn?,
77233,I thought you Frostwolves were supposed to be skilled?,
77234,"Not so easy to fight a Thunderlord, is it?",
77236,You mongrels are no match for my blade!,
77237,If you had just joined the Iron Horde I wouldn't have to kill you now.,
77240,Hatock! You cannot hide from me!,
77327,Frostwolves! Fan out and harry the Thunderlord. For vengeance!,
77375,Honored brothers and sisters! Today we achieved what Durotan would not even dare to try.,
77376,Make no mistake. We are at war. And we need a Warchief!,
77377,Those of you bold enough to stand with me - come! We will show the world the might of the Frostwolves!,
77378,We... are... FROSTWOLVES!,
77398,,This is the Arbitum.
77399,,The Prophet foresaw a time in our future when our people would come into grave danger.
77400,,This shrine holds the power to save us from destruction.
77401,,I pray that the day of judgment shall never come. Power like this can only come at great cost.
77402,,Activation of The Arbitum requires an incredible amount of energy - energy of a kind that can't be found on this world.
77403,,"Luckily, Iris Crystals do not originate from Draenor. We think three should be enough to supply the energy we need."
77404,,Five Iris Crystals have fallen from the skies around Shadowmoon Valley.
77405,,"Unfortunately, it looks like the Shadowmoon are collecting them as well. We cannot allow them to succeed."
77406,,This is the Prophet's vision of what will come to pass.
77407,,"Do you know the workings of our magic, traveler?"
77408,,"See this hammer? In my hands, it strikes with magical force against enemies. But used by an inexperienced trainee, it is no more than a blunt rock."
77409,,The Arbitum is only as powerful as the one who uses it.
77410,,"In the right hands, it restores hope for this world. In the wrong ones, it is a weapon of absolute destruction."
77478,"Spirits of the water, I seek your guidance. Spirits of the earth, I seek your strength.",
77479,I... I hear the voice of a Fury!,
77489,"Fly with me, hero. We will assist them from above!",
77490,The purifying light of the naaru is both our hammer AND shield.,
77491,They are at the very temple gates - fly closer! Hurry!,
77492,Circle back. We must clear the steps.,
77493,Exarch Akama! Watch your flanks!,
77494,"Thank you, old friend!",
77495,Never again will you orcish hordes darken the light of Karabor!,
77496,Press onward. By the light of the Naaru!,
77498,,Watch out! Goren!
77502,"Spirits of fire, I seek ferocity- aaaaaah!",
77503,"Hold, $p! This is not our enemy.",
77504,,"Drek'Thar! $p, cover me."
77505,,Hear it faster! We are getting swarmed down here.
77548,,"Let your wolf guide you Drek'Thar, and stay close to me if you can. $p, look for us in the Ice Forges when you are finished. Lok'tar ogar!"
77569,,"Rulkan was Ner'zhul's most trusted advisor for many years. Ner'zhul's strength and ambition guided our lives, but Rulkan's wisdom and vision inspired our spirits."
77570,,Ner'zhul's methods are brutal and direct. He cuts his enemies down by force.$B$BRulkan is clever and wise. She will turn an enemy's own blade against them.
77571,,"The Shadowmoon Clan is no longer. Even if physical remnants remain, its spirit is corrupted."
77572,,We are here in self-exile. We refused to tap the magic of Ner'zhul's Dark Star.
77573,,"It is unclear what will happen to us from here, but one thing is certain. My loyalty to Chieftess Rulkan is absolute."
77586,"Draka, help me up. We shou- hrraarh!",
77587,"Do not forget, child, one of us is blind and unable to call upon the spirits like he used to.",
77588,,"Bah! That should just come close to making it a fair fight. On your feet, old man."
77589,What hope is there against a foe that can consume the very elements?,
77590,,"You taught me long ago that the elements have always been there for us. Now it is our turn to be there for them. Victory or death, we owe it to them to try."
77593,%s rumbles in assent.,
77595,$C! You have freed my children and made me whole. Accept my boon and bring the full fury of Frostfire to your enemies.,
77596,"Shaman, you alone were strong enough to hear my call. You were wise enough to know what needed to be done. Give me your totem.",
77602,Feel the flames of the fury!,
77604,"Exurotus was always believed to be a legend. A story told from shaman to shaman as a symbol of a true elemental spirit.$b$bTo see something so revered in shackles is an affront to orcs, to shamanism, and to me.",
77609,"The stench of tortured stone fills the air, Draka. What do you see?",
77610,I can feel hundreds of goren burrowing through the earth. This will not be easy.,
77612,,Goren... lots of goren. We will distract them in order to sneak you into the Ice Forge.
77613,"What you suggest should be good enough to bring down a forger, but only for a few seconds at a time.",
77681,Spirits of the wind! Heed my call! We have need of your wisdom.,
77705,This is not a place Frostwolves tread. Be mindful of what shadows you step in.,
77750,,"I am sworn by duty. If we are needed, we will be there. Come, Vindicators!"
77751,,"Hmmm... yes, you make a compelling point. Come, vindicators!"
77754,"Come, child. Find safe refuge in my totem.",
77757,"So many? Very well. When the Prophet calls, the rangari answer. Follow me, men! Velen requests our aid!",
77758,"I place my trust in Velen's wisdom. He is, after all, the Prophet of my people. Follow me, men!",
77764,"It is done? Good. Once this battle is over, we will have to begin repairing Karabor's proper shield defenses.",
77769,"You are a friend of the anchorites, visitor. I will see you back at the rallying point.",
77792,"Carry this symbol of my gratitude into battle, and its fire shall join with your own to burn your enemies to ash.",
77793,We are the only ones close enough to collect these pieces and unleash the fury.,
77840,"Your security is lax, Chieftain. I caught these Rangari spies within your gates.",
77841,They are too late. The prisoners are already on their way to Anguish Fortress.,
77842,"Their blood will summon forth the Dark Star, and make me as a God among the Iron Horde!",
77843,"The Warchief honors deeds, not words, shadowcaster.",
77844,Seal the exits! No draenei scum leaves this village alive!,
77848,Thunderlord... I have failed you...,
77855,,Husband...
77856,Enough! You scheming draenei can keep your precious temple... for now.,
77857,The Iron Horde will return!,
77858,I will move ahead and prepare a staging area for our counter-attack.,
77881,These orcs have violated the sanctity of Karabor. Their attack ends NOW!,

77895,"$n, you come with me.",
77999,"Yes... Very good. Around Shadowmoon Valley are four arkonite crystals, ancient wreckage from our vessel.",
78000,"I thought we would never need their power, but the time has come. Take my staff, and gather their energy for me.",
78001,"All right, give me one moment...",
78005,There are still enemies among us. EVERYONE TO ARMS!,
78061,"You must defeat Commander Vorka. There he is, at the very gates of Karabor.",

78090,Furious little orcling!,
78091,In your blind rage you rush to face my ogres alone.,
78092,"They will end you, little lone wolf.",
78093,Your conquered clan will fill my slave pens...,
78113,I'll drown you in the blood of your little army!,
78142,I will get these orcs to safety and meet with you outside.,

78160,Let's go.,Let's go.
78161,I... feel... better! You've done the right thing! Now I shall go see what your wolf chief has to say.,

78391,,Gah! He tried to stab me! I told you we couldn't trust the Laughing Skulls.
78392,Limbflayer forgot to be nice. I saw pretty orc. I wanted to see if she could dance. Sorry. Sorry.,
78393,"I have come to hunt the Iron Horde. I could destroy what remains of your ruined village, or perhaps we could assist one another.",
78394,"Yes, wolves and skulls need each other. You need to know where the big Iron Hordy weapon is at. We need your $p.",
78396,You have proven yourself loyal to my clan. Capable of great things.,
78397,"Our hold on Bladespire is tenuous, and some of my best warriors have raced off with my reckless brother.",
78398,I was impressed by your skill in our battle against Dorogg the Ruthless.,
78399,I would be honored if you continued to fight by our side.,
78464,I will block the temple against any more damage.,
78465,"Go, $n. I will hold the temple gates!",
78487,Look out!,
78574,,Fan out! Leave nothing alive!
78809,"Let's get movin', then!",
78810,Lemme just get her warmed up...,
78811,"Come on, baby girl...",
78812,There we go!,
78813,"This way. There is a safe spot up ahead, just outside the Iron Horde's facilities.",
78814,I s'pose priority number one is to take care o' that nasty giant cannon.,
78815,"Did somebody say ""giant cannon""?",
78816,Soon enough. Our first priority is to find Yrel. She is out there somewhere.,
78817,"D'kaan, you and our champion did some scouting earlier. What did you find?",
78818,"...nothing conclusive, Vindicator.",
78819,"I see. Well then, we will just have to...",
78839,I'll dispatch artificers to secure the crystals to the north.,
78840,And what of Ner'zhul? Will we let him take our people without retribution?,
78841,"Patience, Maraad. A rescue will require planning - do not rush into danger until we know where our people are.",
78842,We made the wrong choice once before. I won't let it happen again. I can't leave our people to die.,
78843,,"I will keep an eye on him, teacher."
78850,,"When the Iron Horde came, they gave our clan a choice. Join them, or die."
78851,,"My husband Ner'zhul chose to save our people. He joined the Iron Horde, but they asked of him a heavy price."
78852,,They said:
78853,,"So Ner'zhul turned to the silent void. He broke the ancient laws, and drew upon the dark star."
78854,,"I pleaded with him to stop, but he would not turn back."
78855,,"By breaking this stone, he forswore all loyalty to our ancestors."
78856,,"I can ask only one thing of you now, stranger."
78857,,You must do what I cannot. Stop Ner'zhul. End his madness before it is too late.
78935,,"Good work, $p! Meet us at the rendezvous. Time to see how to drive this beast."
79155,"What good are stars and visions against steel and powder? Make a worthy offering, or your people shall die.",
79164,,"The Shadowmoon fortress is sealed to outsiders, but this keystone will allow entry. Good luck, hero."
79229,"Ner'zhul! Your army is scattered, your fortress in ruins.",
79230,"Your ""dark star"" has fallen, and now serves the draenei. You are a disgrace!",
79231,"We would still serve the Iron Horde, Hellscream. Our magic is-",
79232,"YOU HAVE NO PLACE IN MY IRON HORDE! Go back to your little village, Ner'zhul.  You can watch the stars while the Iron Tide washes over you.",
79233,"Go back to your little village, Ner'zhul.  You can watch the stars while the Iron Tide washes over you.",
79234,"Korhol, Zhakta, Trokar... move in from all sides. Gargrak, hold for now.",
79235,ZHAKTA NO!... you will be avenged!,
79237,"Dammit all. Gargrak, go now... kill the blind shaman.",

79336,Wait... what is that light?,
79377,Stand back!,
79379,It seems the elements of Draenor do not respond to me as they do on Azeroth...,
79380,Go on ahead. Durotan awaits. I must catch my breath.,
79388,To Bladespire! Attack!,
79389,There is no time to waste! We strike NOW!,
79397,"Dorogg has fallen! Stay close, Frostwolves - the citadel is not yet ours.",
79400,Press the attack!,
79401,The Frostwolves will triumph.,
79402,This fortress will fall.,
79403,Do not give up!,
79404,Gather your strength!,
79406,"Carry the light, brothers and sisters!",
79408,That was barely a scratch! I should recover quickly.,
79435,"It is up to you, champion. I will stay here and help with the wounded slaves you rescued.",
79437,,Nothing worthwhile ever is.
79443,"Drek'Thar, old friend, you're alive!",
79445,"I know your eyes don't work, shaman, but this one has green skin.",
79446,Hmph. Yes. Ga'nar is already causing trouble.,
79447,"Very well, strangers. You have earned the trust of our shaman. I will not turn away the help.",
79448,"I can barely stand. But for the actions of these heroes, I would be dead.",
79449,"These are champions from a faraway realm, pledged to fight the Iron Horde.",
79450,I do not need eyes to see it; they are noble of heart. They saved our kin -- including your brother.,
79451,"Come, friends. If you wish to fight with our clan, we welcome you to receive our blessings.",
79452,Reach out to the Shamanstone. Embrace the wisdom of this land and the ancestors that came before us.,
79458,Warriors! Today the tide turns.,
79459,We will claim Bladespire Citadel as our own.,
79460,Fight as one. We win this - together!,
79461,"Ga'nar is a great fighter, but he is impatient. He has taken some of our best warriors with him.",
79462,He never listens. His ruthlessness may cost us.,
79463,Here - Gormaul Tower. This will be our foothold. Leave none alive! LOK'TAR OGAR!,
79465,The Bladespire ogres threw me into that hellhole. I'll notch my axe with their skulls until vengeance is mine!,
79466,"Bladespire Citadel! I will have my vengeance on those ogres, even if I have to tear it down stone by stone.",
79468,"My friends, you have earned a hero's welcome. Follow us to the Frostwolf Chieftain.",
79470,"My eyes may not work, but the familiar chill of the air is comforting.",
79472,Ah yes. Garad's youngest: a noble soul named Durotan.,
79473,"Wise beyond his years, but still young. I fear he has been thrust into the Gronn's jaws - our people are in great danger.",
79475,You mentioned the Frostwolf Chieftain...,
79476,Durotan!,
79482,,Fomic ore is tougher than hardened steel. You will need my goren-toothed pick axe to cut through the rock.
79483,,The spirits were kind to guide you to me at this moment.
79484,,It is done! The blade is forged.
79487,,"You now stand before Na'Shra! Weaponsmith of the Frostwolf Clan. For your service, I give you mine."
79495,You are hurt. Your flesh is pale.,
79500,The battle is joined. Lok-Narash!,
79501,Reinforcements approach. Attack!,
79502,The stench of a boar beast. Beware its tusks... Charge!,
79503,The tower is ours! Regroup and press on!,
79504,"I will ride ahead. Frostwolves, hold the tower. Igrimar, with me!",
79505,I will forestall any counterattacks by the enemy. Lok'tar ogar!,
79533,"Stand down, Warlord. It is over.",
79536,...Fenris?,
79579,No slave fights with the will of one who is free.,
79584,The Thunderlords retreat! They are making their way through Thunder Pass to the Iron Horde.,
79585,They are going to retaliate. We must be ready.,
79588,What is this...?,
79595,"No, I will never be okay with this.",
79596,Come! To Thunder Pass. We are outnumbered 50 to 1. They don't stand a chance!,
79597,"Thank you, child. I can always count on you.",
79603,"There! Is this what you seek, Prophet?",
79609,,"Kron approaches! Champion, with me."
79619,If I try to release Exurotus it is sure to bring Kron down on us.,
79621,"We have company, Master.",
79622,"Tagar, deal with the intruder.",
79624,"Frostwolves! The Iron Horde is coming. As we speak, they march on Thunder Pass.",
79625,"But the Frostwolf clan is reunited! Together, we can protect this land!",
79626,"Lok-Narash, Frostwolves! Prepare for battle!",
79627,"You know me, brother. I'm always ready to fight.",
79638,"Hold your position, Frostwolves! Let them come to you!",
79640,Axes up! Here they come again!,
79641,We can't fight with this cannon fire coming down. Thrall! $p! Take care of that tank!,
79653,"Drek'Thar's in trouble. Ga'nar, get out there and lend him a hand.",
79655,"You go too, $p.  Make sure my brother doesn't get himself killed.",
79659,Fall back! Prepare for the next attack!,
79661,Spears incoming! Hold your ground!,
79665,"Hero, approach my totem for aid!",
79667,I'll be waiting.,
79676,Frostwolves! Stand strong! The battle is nearly done!,
79677,Drek'Thar! How much time do you need?,
79679,"We are counting on you, shaman!",
79681,I do. Something big is coming.,
79683,GRONN!,
79684,All Frostwolves - charge ahead! Take that thing down!,
79691,"Draka, make your way to the cave the scout spotted. I will meet the commander at the coastal village.",
79692,"Champion, we will meet you ahead when you are done with your mission.",
79698,,Lead it away from Drek'Thar!
79706,Exurotus is too weak. The most I can do is free him of his bonds. Death will claim him shortly afterward.,
79707,If I were stronger...,
79708,,There must be something you can do.
79709,The fury is dying. We don't have much time.,
79710,"There might be something. Exurotus, I offer my spirit as host to your own. Join with me, so that your fire may not be quenched.",
79712,MY SPIRIT... BURNS!,
79713,,"Drek'Thar, what has it done to you?"
79714,He has become one with the fury. Their spirits are now merged.,
79716,"I... I can see. I can see the shift of the elements, the movement of the spirits through the land. It is glorious.",
79718,The ogres will suffer for what they've done!,
79736,We will secure our borders!,We will secure our borders!
79757,Flowers?! Noooooo!,
79758,Please... no flowers...,
79759,Not me! Not now!,
79760,Not like this...,
79761,The legends are true!,
79762,Anything but flowers!,
79764,Flowers?,
79782,,So the wolves have come to play with the skulls? I will speak with Durotan but I will not hold out hope. His wolves are soft and lack conviction.
79788,Ahhh!!!!! Finish it! Just let me die!,
79820,"No excuses, Kor'gall. We are at WAR with another world. Motivate your people, get a mining pick yourself, I do not care. You WILL meet your quota or find your clan the target of our next weapon test.",
79821,"Here, let me make some adjustments.",
79822,There ya go.,
79843,Durotan? Draka? What are YOU doing here?,
79845,Orgrim Doomhammer! You will be made to answer for your attack on my people!,
79849,"Stay your hand, hero. I want him alive.",
79851,"I have not forgotten or forgiven that. But Orgrim was once an honorable orc, and my closest friend. I owe it to him to at least try to help him regain some of his honor.",
79852,"Always sentimental, Durotan. I am as loyal to my people as you are to yours. Do not presume that I walk this path willingly. Some things are more important than honor.",
79853,,Husband? It was his forces that killed your brother.
79873,So much for subtlety. Those Laughing Skull are going to get us all killed.,
79874,Hmph. I remember ogre architecture being more formidable.,
79892,I issued no such order. I wanted your people to join us and protect this world from the threat of those beyond the portal.,
79901,You are my vanguard.,
79902,These shores are ours!,
79903,Leave no enemy alive!,
79904,"Iron will, iron blood.",
79905,Go forth to victory!,
79909,"Not long ago, we were orcs of many clans, quibbling over scraps in a world that was ours for the taking.",
79910,"Now, as one clan, no enemy can hope to stand against the Iron Horde!",
79911,We will crush their bones beneath our boots.  We will burn their cities to ash!,
79912,The iron tide washes over them!,
79914,The doom that is coming will destroy us all. These outsiders will bring a wave of fire and death down upon us if the orcs do not act as one to destroy them first.,
79915,"Because I have witnessed it! Every night! Every night for many months now. My dreams become nightmares, and in those nightmares I watch helplessly as the land corrupts beneath our feet and the sky is turned to fire.",
79916,"Say what you will, but this is the doom that is coming. And it is these creatures from beyond the portal that will bring it.",
79917,And how can you be so certain of such a fate?,
79918,,I have never known the great Doomhammer to be afraid of anything.
79919,Cho'gall! I sent you here to enslave this thing.,

80107,"Light. Pure light. Hope in times of despair, brightness in our darkest hour!",
80108,Ner'zhul's ritual... begins! We are out of time!,
80109,We must stop the Shadowmoon Chieftain.,
80110,"What needs to be done, child.",
80111,"Hurry, champion. I will get there as soon as I can.",
80112,Do whatever you can to delay Ner'zhul...,
80113,,Prophet! What have you done to yourself!?

80121,,LAUGHING SKULL! LAUGHING SKULL! HAHAHAHAHA!
80147,This forest is ours!,
80165,Yrel! We will spill some orcish blood...,
80166,I am your Chieftain; you and your warriors will fall back in line.,
80167,OUR - FATHER - would BE - ASHAMED - of WHAT - YOU'VE - BECOME!,
80168,Our strength comes from working together.,
80169,[PH] Temporary cut-scene with my brother? Let's do it!,
80191,"Yrel, walk with us a moment...",
80230,I... already told you... all that I know...,
80268,The Iron Horde will not hesitate to use that cannon on our base. We should find a more tactical location.,
80269,Is everyone alright?,
80270,I think I soiled m'self...,
80271,My ALE was back there...,
80272,"Yes, everyone appears to be alright.",
80273,"Very well. We will set up camp ahead, and deal with this cannon.",
80274,Yrel will have to wait.,
80296,Everybody in the Tank. Yrel is being held as a slave in the Stonemaul ogres' slave camp.,
80297,Yrel might already be free if it weren't for the actions of one deceitful rangari.,
80298,"I did what I thought was right, Vindicator. The missing girl seems to be distracting you from our mission.",
80299,"Yeah, what's so special about this girl anyway?",
80300,I lost her once. I will not lose her again.,
80301,Now THAT'S somethin' I can get behind.,
80302,"Besides, the ogres're sellin' slaves to the Iron Horde. Stoppin' ta beat 'em up fer a bit is well within the scope o' our mission.",
80303,You all is gonna get smashed.,
80304,"Oh no, ogre, that's where you have it wrong. You see, we are the ones that will be doing the smashing today. Thaelin?",
80305,"Aye aye, cap'n!",
80306,"Now is our chance! Forward, Thaelin, with speed!",
80307,What da...?,
80308,"Stay silent, all of you! Ogre, if you so much as GRUNT, I will personally beat the Light out of you.",
80309,We can set up over there.,
80310,Ok'mokk didn't make no sounds at all. You don' need ta smash Ok'mokk.,
80311,"Ach, I have a feelin' yer gonna get smashed anyway.",
80312,A direct attack. A bold decision.,
80313,Gathering allies. Wise decision.,
80314,"Form up, everyone. We are headed to Smokebelcher Depot.",
80315,"Form up, everyone. We are headed to the Planteau. [TEMP NAME]",
80316,,Room for one more on that elekk?
80317,"Always, my love.",
80318,"Yrel, did you learn anything about the Goliath Cannon before your capture?",
80319,,"A bit. The one you destroyed was merely a prototype. The actual cannons are built in the foundry, to the north."
80320,,I overheard one of the orcish leaders discussing a plan to use them on Shattrath.
80321,Shattrath? Ha! Even that big ol' hunk o' metal couldn't hit Shattrath from here.,
80322,They could if it was loaded onta' a boat.,
80323,"I suspected the same thing. They must plan to load the cannons onto barges at the Naval Base, in the northeast.",
80324,Our small group would never survive an attack on the Naval Base. Too fortified.,
80325,We will continue attacking their supply lines.,
80326,,"D'kaan, how long have you been scouting out here in Gorgrond?"
80327,"A very long time. Longer than you've been alive, probably by two or threefold.",
80328,D'ye get lonely?,
80329,A rangari who is not lonely is not doing his job.,
80330,Sounds like a crap job to me. Life ain't worth livin' if y'don't have lads and a lass t'come home to.,
80331,,"Do you have a wife, Hansel?"
80332,Ach... the Blackrocks took 'er away.,
80333,"That's half o'why I'm here: ta look after Thaelin, and ta get me wife back.",
80334,"We will find your wife, Hansel. And we will leave a wake of bodies behind us. The orcs will pay with blood for what they did to our families.",
80335,"Y'know, that's the darkest, coldest, most inspirin' thing I've ever heard from the lips of a paladin.",
80336,"Our work here is done. Next, we head to Smokebelcher Depot.",
80337,"Our work here is done. Next, we head to the Planteau.",
80338,,"Thaelin, are you doing alright in there?"
80339,"Quite fine, ma'am. Just happy to be out o' combat and back in me Tank.",
80340,,<sigh> This land is plagued by war. Do you think you'll return to the safety of home after our mission is done?
80341,"I dunno how much you've heard about Azeroth, ma'am, but we've got our fair share of war, too.",
80342,"Once I've found me Ellie, I know I'll be headed back ta Searin' Gorge.",
80343,"What about you, lassie? Will ye go home?",
80344,,"With Velen gone, I feel like I don't have a home anymore."
80345,"We are draenei, Yrel. Being without a home is in our nature.",
80346,,"I was thinking I might go through the portal with you, my love."
80347,"Yes, Yrel. You will have a home on Azeroth.",
80348,"But first, we will make these orcs suffer for what they did to you. Their sins cannot be forgiven.",
80349,,"Maraad, you're frightening me."
80350,"The Iron Horde's supply lines are now cut, however temporarily. We have forged our alliance with the Shapers.",
80351,There will never be a better time than this. Let us head to the Naval Base and exact our vengeance on the Iron Horde!,
80352,,"What is our plan, Maraad?"
80353,We will slay as many of the vile things as we can. We will burn their homes and show them fear.,
80354,"I will make them feel the pain I felt when I lost you, Yrel.",
80355,,Maraad... I am honored...
80356,,...but perhaps you are taking your vengeance too far. Have you forgotten what the Prophet taught us?
80357,"The prophet is DEAD, Yrel. Look what his teachings did for him.",
80358,"Ye've gone too far, Maraad.",
80359,The Light's left ye. Even I can see that.,
80360,"I carry no particular love for the Light, but I agree. You need to remember what you stand for, Vindicator.",
80361,"Are any of you more holy than me? I am the LEADER of this expedition, and I will not be questioned any further!",
80362,"The Light has not left me, Thaelin. No... the Light has finally shown me its true form.",
80363,Vengeance.,
80364,I saw the naaru's vengeance in the Purge of Grommar. I was there as K'ara herself unleashed holy death upon the filthy hordes.,
80365,[UNUSED],
80366,,"Maraad, my love. That's enough."
80367,Yrel...,
80368,,"You have been through too much, Maraad. Your thirst for vengeance will only lead to our death."
80369,,[UNUSED]
80370,,Rest now. I will lead our attack on the Naval Base.
80371,"I'm with you, Yrel.",
80372,"I, too, will follow you.",
80373,And I.,
80374,Very well.,
80375,"Thank you, Yrel. I don't know what's coming over me.",
80492,It is no matter. These souls are mine. My power grows.,
80493,Auchindoun will be mine! I will devour every last soul and bathe the ashes in hellfire!,
80533,,"Yes, Tuulani. Now you see."
80534,,Your efforts were valiant. I did not think the anchorites could power the defenses with only one of the crystals.

80632,,Mother?

80896,We are home.,
80913,,"What do you make of it, Thrall?"
80914,"It reeks of hatred and dust, Choluna. I don't like having it here at the garrison.",
80915,I'd like it even less in the hands of the Iron Horde.,
80916,We should destroy it.,

82199,"With luck, the small ones will now flee, and we can begin construction.",
82215,"We won't go without a fight, Deadeye.",
82258,Mm.,
82259,This slaver and torturer knows nothing of honor.,
82260,We cannot hide here forever.,
82261,Step into my arena and die with honor.,
82262,"You have entered my arena, strangers. You will either leave it as victors, or as corpses.",
82263,Such is the way of the SHATTERED HAND.,
82264,"A combat arena. This may be a trap, but at least we will die with honor.",
82361,,"Hurry, Yrel. Your hammer's might will help us greatly."
82486,I'll move forward and scout their gates while you're taking out those catapults. Lok'tar ogar!,
82494,"Commander, Over here!",
82496,Damn these ogres and their magic! I can't find a way to bring the barrier down so we're just going to have to sneak in around it.,
82497,"I'll go first and clear the way, meet me on the other side.",
82525,"Blood and thunder, what a battle!",
82530,Let's kill some ogres!,

82569,The purifying light of the naaru is both our hammer AND shield.,
82570,They are at the very temple gates - fly closer! Hurry!,
82571,Circle back. We must clear the steps.,

82573,"Thank you, old friend!",
82574,Never again will you orcish hordes darken the light of Karabor!,
82575,Press onward. By the light of the naaru!,
82576,"Carry the light, brothers and sisters!",
82577,We've done all we can from up here...,
82578,We did it! We broke the blockade!,
82579,We've broken the main siege. We should meet with our forces on the ground.,
82580,These are the last of our forces. We'll stay here to hold the temple gates.,
82581,"Champion, I need you to fight your way to the harbor.",
82582,,"I'll approach the enemy from the south. Light of the naaru, guide you."
82583,,"Champion, the naaru has come to aid us. We must defend it while it gathers power!"
82584,,We've done it! Now to put an end to this assault...
82585,Witness the TRUE power of the Iron Horde!,
82586,ENOUGH. Play time is over. I will deal with you myself.,
82587,,Up there! The fleet commander shows himself.
82588,,What is the naaru doing?
82589,It is done. Victory is ours!,
82590,,"Hero, you fought fearlessly. For that, please accept my thanks."
82592,"Greetings, savior of my people!",
82593,"If you are hearing this message, it means that I am no more - but Karabor is safe.",
82594,I owe you an explanation.,
82595,The naaru that we draenei revere are creatures of pure light.,
82596,"But if their death is near, they lose their essence, collapsing into creatures of shadow.",
82597,"When we draenei first arrived on this world, naaru accompanied us. But they could not stop our vessel from crashing.",
82598,"The ""Dark Star"" that appeared in the skies above Draenor that terrible night was no celestial body.",
82599,"It was a fallen naaru, ejected from our vessel in moments of panic and terror. Its name was K'ara.",
82600,"What was once a creature of faith and beauty became a dark and hungering God, a living font of darkness.",
82601,"We owed K'ara a great debt. Without the naaru's aid, my people would never have escaped our homeworld of Argus.",
82602,To see K'ara's transformation into shadow was a heavy burden to bear. When the naaru returned to us... I did what I had to do.,
82603,"Remember, life is the light, and light is life itself. They may be exchanged, but nothing is ever lost.",
82676,Darkness... comes...,
82677,The shadows grow closer!,

82963,"You three! Follow $p onto the battlefield, and listen for my call.",
82964,I have a plan.,
82969,"And the Raven Mother spoke to me: Krikka, you are my dear child. You shall seek out my other wayward children and bring them back to the nest.",

83058,"There is no place to run, outsiders. This is MY world. We will find you!",
83060,"We Frostwolves will be waiting for you, Hellscream! You, your ogres, your whole Iron Horde... You're as good as dead!",
83061,"Ignore his threats. We will go to Shadowmoon for reinforcements. This time, the draenei will triumph.",
83062,Let's get underway then. We will need to build a stronghold if we hope to end the Iron Horde threat. And we're going to need help from the natives.,
83063,To Shadowmoon!,
83064,To the home of the Frostwolves!,
83102,,I'll move forward and scout their gates while you're taking out those catapults. Dioniss aca.

83127,That danged army should be here any minute. Let's move!,

83431,"Free at last! Join me in the ogre mound when you are done, and we shall slay the ogre chieftain together.",
83635,"Bring them to me alive, Roltall. They will fetch an excellent price.",
83688,The Iron Horde have landed upon these shores. It is our task to make them regret it.,
83711,In here!,
83718,"We cannot stay here long. Soon, the entirety of the Iron Horde will be upon us.",
83719,"$n, our champion, will stay back and disrupt the enemy camp. The rest of us will seek safe passage through the jungle.",

83762,AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!,
83774,,"Exarch, have your soulbinders meet me at my camp. I intend to stop Teron'gor before he unleashes more demons."

84023,Then I guess we owe you one.,

84250,Yes... step closer! I will bury you alive for the glory of the Iron Horde!,
84268,Worthless...,
84374,I've seen it in my dreams... these strangers from other worlds would burn everything we've fought for.,
84375,But it is orc blood that runs in the veins of Draenor!,
84376,"Go forth, Iron Horde!  Make corpses of our enemies.",
84377,For the glory of Grommash!,

84446,Your power? (It's MY power!),

84448,I think not. (We're done taking orders from you!),
84463,We've learned much from K'ure. (We're writing a book.),

84581,Gul'dan! Gul'dan powers the portal!,
84658,"I admit, even in Socrethar's madness, there was a hint of truth.",
84659,"He questioned our complacency. Perhaps we have been too content, too SAFE, hiding here on Draenor.",
84660,"A call is coming, hero. I feel it, large and looming, just beyond the horizon. When the time  comes, the draenei must answer.",
84662,,"Today, we have defeated one of Gul'dan's strongest allies."
84663,,"Without their leader, the Sargerei will crumble. The Auchenai will soon be able to reclaim their city."
84665,,"For now, we can consider this a monumental victory. Thank you, hero."

85018,"Again, Blackhand? All I hear are excuses.",
85019,Azuka! How goes the search for the alpha?,
85020,,"Well, Warchief. We need only the Heart of Gorgorek to give it life."
85021,Good. I will have you deal with the other-worlders as well. Or... do you lack the bloodlust of your forefathers?,
85022,,"My blade skills surpass those of my sires, Warchief. I can clean up Blackhand's mess."
85023,Hrahh... I will slice off your tongue for that!,
85024,Ahahaha... bold words from my newest Warlord. Very well!,
85026,Carry forth your ancestral blade. Bathe it in the blood of our enemies. Show me its legendary power.,

86788,"Lay down your weapons, Grommash! Look around you. You are lost.",
86789,"Wait then, Grommash. Wait, because we are coming for you.",
86790,"Thank you, hero.  Today, we taste victory! Lok'tar ogar!",
86947,My next pet won't be so easy!,
86948,All's fair in tiny monkeys and war.,
86949,"What? How?? I will have my revenge, you liver-scented codswallup!",
86950,"A fitting conclusion to yet another epic battle, featuring me!",
86951,Prepare for the smiting of a lifetime!,
86952,"Ah, lucky for you I was not paying attention this time!",
86958,"As powerful as I am, I cannot be everywhere at once.",
86959,"But you, commander, are my greatest resource. Between the skill of your allies and the might of your garrison, there is not a stronghold that can withstand you.",
86960,"Under your leadership, the full might of the Alliance expeditionary force will engage the Iron Horde.",
86961,"Under your command, the Horde's greatest warriors will engage Grommash and his army.",
86962,But I will be concentrating on the single greatest threat to the safety of Azeroth:,
86963,Gul'dan. Darkness incarnate.,
86964,"In all my years, Gul'dan is the craftiest, most diabolical foe I have ever encountered. I hold myself accountable for his release.",
86965,We MUST find and eliminate Gul'dan and his nascent Shadow Council network.,
86966,"With your help, I can track him down. I will ask a great deal of you. I will task you to the very edge of your abilities.",
86967,But I will also help you as much as I am able. Together we will create for you an artifact of legendary power.,
86968,"With a core forged from the heart of Draenor's sun, this ring is a foundation upon which we will build a wonder.",
86969,...there! It is done. Now to find Gul'dan.,
86970,"Follow me, commander!",
86971,"Once we locate Gul'dan, we may have to move quickly...",
86972,"My eyes are open: Van shalach, om aeschis, khaz'tolim!",
86973,"Come on, come on... Where are you...",
86974,Wait - here - what...?,
86975,Hiding! He's countering my spell.,
86976,"Champion, killing Teron'gor must've shaken him up. That's good. But now he knows we're getting closer.",
86977,We need... more power!,
86979,,We'll track you from the air!
86980,The trail will not be easy to follow. Start by heading east.,
86981,,Follow the trail of time anomalies like this.
86982,,Here! It looks like Garrosh came down this way alone after he first arrived on Draenor. But where was Kairoz?
86983,Look at Garrosh. His hands are bound. But he's alone. When did he and Kairoz part ways?,
86984,,Hmmm... That ogre shouldn't be here. Something strange must've happened up on this ridge.
86985,Who is that?,
86986,,That's Kairoz in disguise. Garrosh killed him! But where was the body?
86987,We must be close!,
87018,I know now how to defeat Gul'dan's magic and reveal the Shadow Council. But we'll need more power.,
87020,We will have to tear artifacts from the very heart of the Ogre Empire.,
87021,I can help you. Let us augment the power of that ring of yours...,
87022,"Hold out your hand, and step into the light!",
87023,"I'm sorry, I should've mentioned that you would be... slightly killed.",
87026,Marvelous... we have everything we need!,
87027,Gul'dan will NOT be able to hide from my gaze this time.,
87028,,"Archmage, be careful."
87030,We have him where we want him!,
87031,"My eyes are open: Val'mir, khar abra, mal ozymius...",
87032,"Come, come, come... I will find you...",
87033,...there! Gul'dan! He is -,
87034,You! The human mage from Tanaan...,
87035,I have found you!,
87036,"I've been inquiring about you, ""Khadgar."" It would seem we have a history.",
87037,Then you know how this ends. Give yourself up.,
87038,Your clumsy magic works both ways. I have also found you.,
87039,,"Archmage, look ou-"
87040,Foolish mage. Your death will be excruciatingly slow. I only wish I could be there to enjoy it.,
87041,,Champion - The archmage!

87056,%s groans in pain.,
87057,,This wound is grisly. You should see a priest.
87061,"No - no priest. Cordana, stitch me up.",
87072,"Come, this way. This will only hurt - well, quite a bit actually.",
87073,"The power once reserved for the Sorcerer Kings, I place in your hands.",
87074,"Omnivus, al-vitrade! Arcanum totalus!",
87075,,"These are dangerous forces you're working with, archmage."
87076,Our friend needs them. The hardest trials are yet to come.,
87085,,I'll be keeping my eyes on you.
87086,,"Good luck, champion. Be careful in that foundry!"
87087,"Now, stand perfectly still.",
87088,"This magic is extremely reliable and - maybe a tiny bit fatal. Hold still, I said!",
87089,"I draw my strength, from the HEART of Draenor...",
87090,"Come, Grommash. Drink.",
87091,I told you - get out!,
87092,They assault your foundry. They murder your allies. Mine is the only way.,
87093,Go!,
87095,,It worked.
87096,"I maintain a pair of goblin jumper cables for just such an emergency. Are you well, commander?",
87098,Come with me. Gul'dan will not give up control of his pet without a fight.,
87099,,"Just kill me and be done with it, archmage."
87100,"I'm not here to kill you, assassin.",
87101,,%s reels in pain.
87102,Where is your master? Tell me!,
87103,,Burn... in a thousand... hells...
87104,You first. Where is Gul'dan!?,
87105,,Argghgh - he - will undo you -
87106,Where is he hiding?,
87107,,Archmage...
87108,TELL ME!,
87109,,%s grasps her head.
87110,,"Khadgar, stop! What's the difference between this and torture?"
87111,But she knows...,
87112,,I don't even know what you're fighting for anymore.
87113,You - you're right. Gul'dan has butchered her mind already.,
87114,"I am sorry, Garona. We will find another way.",
87156,"If she is searching for this ""Heart of Gorgorek,"" then we must find it before her. I will notify you as soon as I learn more.",
87157,"Commander, this will be a protracted campaign. I should have more information for you in a week's time.",
87158,"If she and da Iron Horde be searchin' for dis ""Heart a Gorgorek,"" den we must find it first. I will send for ya when I hear more.",
87159,"Commander, dis will be a long campaign. I will have more information for ya in a week's time.",
87198,"It looks like everyone is in position. Ka'alu, give the signal and get us out of here!",
87393,There are still Iron Horde in the northern courtyard.,
87419,"Gro the Uncreator, I call to you!",
87420,"The spirits of the Laughing Skull have spoken. We must join together to fight our common enemy, the Iron Horde!",
87421,Yes! It is working! The spirits were right!,
87423,Xuk...,
87447,"Ahhh, there it is. There's MY artifact. How foolish of me to trust Brak with something so valuable.",
87448,"It's a shame that you're too late to stop me. Surrender the artifact, and I will allow you to escape with your lives.",
87449,"Hahahaha, so be it! IRON HORDE, ADVANCE!",
87450,See what weapons I have in my arsenal!,
87451,You will never withstand the might of Goc!,
87452,RELEASE THE IRON STARS!,

87454,ARGH... UNBELIEVEABLE! You will DIE for your insolence! I'LL TEAR YOU LIMB FROM LIMB!,
87455,NO! I will DIE before I let you take what is mine! YOU... WILL NOT... WIN... THIS... WAR! AAARRRRGHH!,
87456,"Hahaha! Not so confident now, are we?! Face me on even ground, cowards!",
87556,The Laughing Skull will rise again!,
88053,,"It is done! As for you, I think it is fitting that one of my tools dispatches the others..."
88605,For Skettis!,
88606,"You trust your eyes too much, fool.",
88712,,"The Light prevails, because WE stand against the darkness."
88942,,What ARE these creatures?
88945,"Go ahead, Ga'nar. Take the clan. Slay your own brother in cold blood. See who follows you then.",

89379,I only hope my people will understand.,
90001,,"Oh, this should be interesting.  You don't mind if I take notes, do you?"
90002,,"It's easy to see why objects such as these would have been highly prized by their cultures!  Er, sorry about your pets."
90003,,Very interesting results.  Thanks for helping me test them out!
90004,,"Well, what can you expect from something that's been buried in the ground for a millennium?"
90005,,"In its native culture, that pet might have been revered as a martyr."
90006,,"Huh, I kinda thought that might happen."
90007,,"Fortunately, Gyraxle can repair anything.  Even himself."
90008,,"Now, was that result the device performing as expected, or did it just explode?"
90009,,All in the name of science.
90011,,I've got bandages in my field kit if you need some...
90012,,You have to respect the ingenuity of such an ancient device.
90014,,I'll add a special thanks to your pet when I publish this research.
90019,,Here we go!
90020,,Oh my pets did so good.  They're going to get so many extra snuggles for that.

90022,,"Don't worry, I'll kiss the boo-boo all better."
90023,,Soup will make you all better!
90024,,Oh no!

90026,,We'll put the rainbow bandage on that.
90027,,Oh no!
90028,,Is your pet sleeping too?
90029,,"You can make your pet all better, right?"
90032,,"You are lucky my wolves are not yet full grown, or else you would have been the meal."
90033,,Only defeat truly exposes our weaknesses.  This loss will improve their training.
90034,,That one was too stupid.
90035,,That one did not lack courage.
90036,,That one won't make that mistake again.
90037,,That one was too slow.
90038,,That one will need some healing.

90040,,A clean kill.
90041,,Hardly even a challenge.
90042,,Why are your pets so weak?
90043,,An easy kill.  My wolves will learn nothing.

90045,I remain the greatest warlord in all of Nagrand!,
90046,What?  How is this possible?  You must have cheated!,
90047,What is one death when I have an army of three?,
90048,My gladiators fight to the death!,
90049,You make Tarr angry!,

90059,,Thanks $gMister:Lady;!  I bet 100 coppers on this fight.
90060,,This is just like the time my home town was overrun by demons.
90061,,"It's okay, they're used to dying."
90062,,Not the first time someone has hunted that one to the ends of the earth.
90063,,Easy now!  I paid a pretty copper for that one.
90064,,I'll sell ya a Stone of Jordan if you promise not to do that again.
90065,,Bad luck just runs in my family.
90066,,"Sorry, $gMister:Lady;."
90067,,"Don't throw that one away, it can still be fixed up."
90068,,That's right!  My pets are from the mean streets of Caldeum.
90069,,"That's a bit of bad luck there, $gMister:Lady;."

90091,,"Fear not, a simple healing spell will set that to rights."
90092,,Life is full of surprises.

90095,,Life is full of surprises.
90096,,It is folly to underestimate the stength of nature.
90097,,"The moth is delicate, but not without defenses."
90098,,Do not despair. Both you and your pet can learn from this.
90099,,A tender lesson learned too late.

107827,,<Ysera Dragon Roar>
107833,The Fel Hammer is ours at last. Gaze upon the might of the Aldrachi Warblades!,
107834,Behold the power of the Aldrachi Warblades. The Fel Hammer is ours!,
108003,Let's begin your lesson in humility.,
108004,Lesson over.,
108005,Begone! I need time to contemplate this affront.,
108006,So undisciplined.,
108007,You will learn respect or I will continue to educate you in it.,
108008,"That one isn't fit to clean my quarters, much less battle!",
108009,"Interesting, show me more.",
108010,An unfortunate miscalculation.,
108011,You cannot discern between a victory or a sacrifice.,
108057,,It is finished! The claws are ours!
108137,Musken! Bless me with fortitude!,
108138,Ha! Musken prove to be the strongest once again!,
108139,I am disgraced.,
108140,Crushed under hoof!,
108141,More! Bring me more to crush!,
108142,Glory in battle!,
108145,Bjorn! Bless me with savagery!,
108146,Ha! Bears prove to be the strongest once again!,
108147,I am disgraced.,
108148,Torn by claws!,
108149,More! Bring me more to rip apart!,
108150,Glory in battle!,
108206,Muster your defenses mortal.,
108207,Join me in the depths.,
108208,Drowning. I am drowning.,
108209,Another soul soon joins us.,
108210,Lay still and let the water take you.,
108211,Death comes quickly to the weak.,
108212,Another takes its place.,
108213,You begin to irritate me mortal.,
108214,Your death will be slow and savored.,
108282,,Let us see if those you have brought are worthy.
108283,,These trials are not to be taken lightly.
108284,,The hunting ground awaits.
108285,,Death should not be feared.
108287,,Life is fleeting.
108288,,Only greatness endures.
108289,,There is another.
108308,"You may enter, but spare me your pleas for help, shaman. I know of the Earthen Ring's plan to unite the elements!",
108309,"The Burning Legion threatens us all, but the power of the Firelands must be earned.",
108311,Approach my throne and we shall see just how far you will go to save this world!,
108469,I must get back to my cooking!,
108470,"Finally. Now, back to my preparations.",
108471,I cannot work in these conditions!,
108472,If you can't take the heat...,
108473,Get out of the kitchen!,
108475,I have superior ingredients!,
108476,Everyone is a critic.,
108477,Smells awful.,
108478,I have to recheck the recipe.,
108648,We have found you... and you have found the grave.,
108649,What's the next step?,
108650,I will begin the ritual. Focus your will upon the spirit while our friend keeps us safe.,
108651,Let's get to it!,
108652,I died to ease the pain of my failure. Why do you disturb me?,
108653,I've read yer saga. Where did ye find the shield?,
108654,"It seems you compel me to answer... My journey took me to Stormheim, to a tomb of warrior kings.",
108655,We will finish what ye started.,
108656,"Return to your rest, and be disgraced no more.",
108659,"Thanks for yer help, Tahu. I won't forget this!",
108660,It was my honor to serve. I must go to Netherlight Temple and inform the Conclave of our success. Good luck.,
108661,"As for us, we should get back to Dalaran. I'll meet ye there!",
108690,Want to know the exact time and date of your death?,
108691,Just as I foresaw it.,
108692,My sight diminishes.,
108693,Sacrifices must be made.,
108694,All will turn to ash.,
108695,I already know your next move.,
108696,All answer to their fate.,
108697,Your fate betrays you mortal,
108703,,"Welcome, Lord of Flame! Welcome, Kil'jaeden!"
108704,"You have done well, Akaari. You have earned my blessing.",
108705,Azhir manari kirel. Akim manari galar!,
108706,,"The fangs... their power is beyond comprehension! I am your humble servant, my lord!"
108707,It is time for your true test. Use the Fangs to dismantle Azeroth's kingdoms from within. Let their shattered husks pave our path to victory!,
108716,,They will taste blood in your name!
109079,"I bid you greetings, Opener of Doors. You are the first.",
109080,"I am Yrgrim, Champion of Tyr! Let us see if you are worthy to bear his shield.",
109092,Long have I waited for one who proves worthy. Face me in battle that we might test your heart!,
109094,"I must see if you possess the will, the strength, and the stamina to wield this shield. Will you face me in a trial of combat?",
109095,"I am ready for your trial, Yrgrim.","I am ready for your trial, Yrgrim."
109100,Let us begin!,
109102,"I am beaten! You are indeed worthy. Were Tyr alive, he would make you his champion. I hereby bestow Truthguard upon you. Use it to defend Azeroth from its enemies.",
109385,,Prophet's mercy! What is that?!
109386,What are you filthy mortals doing near the master's portal? I'll rip the answer from your souls!,
109651,,Formations!
109653,,Again!
109654,,Well done. Make sure to practice every day.
109655,,You need to riposte!
109656,,Keep at it.
109657,,Practice the basics.
109658,,Nicely done.
109659,,Now for the counter-attack!
109663,,Press your advantage.
110387,"We have the hammer! Everyone, run! The tomb is collapsing!",
110388,Your escape... means nothing. Will find you again...,
110975,Apologies for the hasty retreat! The tomb's collapse was triggered by the hammer's removal.,
111093,"Her exemplary deeds in the name of the Ebon Blade have shown her to be one of the best of us, worthy of our highest honor.",
111097,"You will all bow to her as you once did to me, and carry out her will against the Legion!",
111788,"Today, we dealt a great blow to the unseen enemies of the Nightmare.",
111790,"However, Xavius, Lord of the Nightmare, still lives. Only when he is defeated, will Azeroth truly be safe.",
111792,"To accomplish this task, I gift you with my blessing. Use my power to serve and protect the wilds.",
111793,"Thank you, druids of the Dreamgrove. May you prosper under the leadership of your new Archdruid.",
111794,Farewell.,
111860,,You're all bark and no bite.
111861,,Teehee!
111862,,I'm going to give you guys the wittle bandages for your wittle boo-boos!
111863,,Salty?
111864,,Corgis. Am I right?
111865,,Woof.
111866,,But he was so cute!
111867,,You're a monster!
111868,,Aww.
112308,By the light of Elune! What happened to the shrine!?,
112319,Well done! Now we can begin our counter attack!,
112427,Your pathetic barriers mean nothing to the Legion!,
112428,The blades are mine!,
112430,I'll never let Ashamane's Fangs fall to your kind!,
112431,Insolent mortal! We will hunt you down! You only delay the inevitable!,
112460,RRAAAUUUGHHHH!,
112472,"Take a good look, brute! You'll never see the Fangs again!",
112473,"Verstok was at the shrine! Find out what's going on up there. I'll meet up with you as soon as I can, $n.",
112508,Well done! The Legion's attack has been broken!,
112509,"What the... the Fangs are gone! What happened, $n?",
112823,"$n, I have been expecting you, though not the traitor, Altruis.",
112826,Illidan.,
112827,No matter. There is little time.,
112828,I entrusted the duplicitous Akama with planning the campaign against the Legion.,
112830,He alone knows every detail. You will need his counsel if you are to succeed.,
112831,You must also regain the Sargerite Keystone to invade the Legion's worlds.,
112832,Find out where the Wardens hid it away.,
112833,We have attracted attention. I must move.,
112834,"You will not be able to contact me like this again. The Illidari are now yours, $n.",
112837,"$n, I have been expecting you. Ah good... Kayn Sunfury.",
112838,My lord.,
112839,There is little time. Listen closely.,
113030,"Can you hear me through this thing, $n? You should be near Verstok's location by now.",
113033,"My foolish protege was in such a rush to escape the Shrine, I'll wager he failed to mask his scent. Shift into cat form and you'll likely detect it.",
113043,"Careful! The ruins are infested by withered, pitiful creatures with an unending hunger for the arcane. The power of the Fangs might have lured some to Verstok's trail.",
113049,Whatever you did seems to have annoyed those withered. This might work to your advantage. See if you can find another switch.,
113093,"Has Verstok gone mad? Wielding the Fangs enhances one's senses, but I'm afraid it also heightened his paranoia.",
113104,"You must get the Fangs away from Verstok, $n. The longer they remain in his possession, the greater his delusion becomes.",
113146,The doors are shut? Look around the courtyard for something that might open them. Just be mindful of the withered.,
113179,"What on Azeroth was that!? Be careful, $n!",
113345,Stick around... it's meal time!,
113346,What's this? Another intruder approaches!,
113372,"For your insolence, your end will be painful and slow!",
113373,This display is meaningless! Your doom is at hand!,
113576,Foolish orc! You will be the first to witness the Legion's arrival into my city.,
113577,Long have I waited for this day. Let us not waste another moment!,
113578,Ered'nash ila mornu nakuun. Ered'nash ban man'ari!,
113644,They come!,
113718,I returned in disgrace and sought to wash away my failure in the blood of others.,
113719,,"Behold, Suramar. Our haven. Our sanctuary."
113720,"There I found the shrine to Tyr's champion, but was denied entry. I tried many times, until I could bear the pain no longer.",
113738,A good start! You fight well!,
113754,,Our prison.
113755,,Elisande and the Legion seek to bring us to heel. Through fear. Through hunger.
114125,,The flame of the shal'dorei flickers. We must re-ignite it.
114334,,We must stir the noble hearts of my people.
114335,,YOU... must show them that Azeroth has not forsaken them.
114590,"Light, hear our prayers... for shadows close in around us.",
114591,"Grant us this one audience, so the Ashbringer may yet save our world.",
114592,"Do you know where it is, Uther? We risk everything if we return to that place.",
114610,"Maxwell, my old friend! It's been too long.",
114612,"You're both doing the Light's work, but if you seek to recover the Ashbringer, you must hurry.",
114613,I can feel the Ashbringer calling out from an island that lies close to the tomb of the evil one. And the blade is not alone...,
114614,"Tirion still lives, but his light is fading. You must move swiftly, or he will perish! That is all I can tell you.",
114615,"Uther, wait! I have more to ask you! Uther!",
114616,"Good luck, friends. Walk always in the Light.",
114617,"Uther, it's really you!",
114829,Moving into position above Niskara.,
114830,Moving into position above Niskara.,
114831,Everyone up top. Commence bombardment!,
114832,Everyone up top. Commence bombardment!,
115262,Silence!,
115263,,I did what I thought was-
115264,I will hear no more. The sentence is death. Proceed.,
115286,Seize her!,
115724,"Tylos, jump us back to Mardum.",
115725,"Tylos, jump us back to Mardum.",
115780,The Doomhammer could be anywhere. We'll have to split up.,
115781,I will speak with the shaman at the Temple of Earth.,
117161,Our evac is almost here. We have to warn the Alliance and Horde.,
117163,They must turn their fleets around. The Broken Shore is a deathtrap.,
117167,"Anything, lieutenant?",
117170,,The island is crawling with demons. Far more than we anticip...
117177,"So, you have uncovered our little secret.",
117189,"Let me assure you, your precious fleets will fall into our trap.",
117190,"You'll never get away with it, Detheroc!",
117191,"Oh, but I will. And you, Mathias Shaw, will help us to do it.",
117192,Now I am the leader of SI:7!,
117228,,We were on the Broken Shore mere hours before the Alliance and Horde fleets arrived.
117716,,Mathias Shaw led our SI:7 team on a secret recon of the island. We were awaiting extraction.
118586,Ahh a gift fit for a queen. You have my thanks...,
118587,Now the power of the arcan'dor is mine!,
118758,"Ahhh, the defenders of the Light arrive. We have been waiting.",
118759,"You can go no further, Balnazzar. I will have justice for my slain brethren!",
118760,"Justice...or vengeance, paladin? Choose carefully, for hatred leads down a dark path.",
118761,You will die by my blade!,
118762,Auuuuughhhhhh! Auuuughhhh!,
118763,"Pitiful. Jarvox, take care of his execution. Slowly and with great agony, if you will.",
119026,Why hello.,
119096,"I see a great darkness looming over Netherlight Temple. The shadow of the Burning Legion, ready to strike.",
119097,"Our order will fall at his hands, everyone within will perish.",
119098,This will be our fate. We are doomed to die at the hands of the dreadlord Balnazzar.,
119099,This will be our fate... unless...,
119100,Noooooooooo!,
119101,"I see a path that leads to our victory! You are there, walking with the Light, guiding us all.",
119103,It's becoming clear.,
119104,An old enemy becomes an ally.,
119105,Forgotten shadows rise!,
119106,All unite under the Light.,
119608,Demons in the throne room! Protect the king!,
119609,Shatter their portals! Drive out the Legion!,

120162,Portals opening! Here they come!,
120184,"Did you think I wouldn't see what you truly are, demon?",
120499,Dagg find da big treasure dis time!,
120671,"By order of the Grand Magistrix, you are hereby charged with sedition. You undermine my authority and must pay the price.",
121034,Akama. Your duplicity is hardly surprising.,
121037,I should have slaughtered you and your malformed brethren long ago.,
121194,"We've come to end your reign, Illidan. My people, and all of Outland, shall be free!",
121491,Citizens of Azeroth.,
121492,Today is the day we turn the tide.,
121493,Today is the day that we re-take our world.,
121494,And send the Legion back to the hell that spawned them.,
121495,Our path is clear.,
121496,The Pillars of Creation await.,
121497,On the Broken Isles!,
121536,Boldly said. But I remain... unconvinced.,
121542,Bring the Vineyards to heel. I will tolerate no more insubordination.,
121689,"Archimonde, you will not be allowed further! The very soul of Azeroth rises against you!",
121690,"The veil is lifted from my eyes, heroes. The shadows retreat, and the Dream beckons.",
121707,"Thank you, heroes.",

121725,,"You cannot hide what you truly are, demon!"
121726,,More of them are in our midst!

121729,Behold the Flames of Azzinoth!,
121731,Maiev... How is it even possible?,
121734,,"You discovered us too late, Illidari! FELBLADE, ATTACK!"
121758,,"Their fury pales before mine, Illidan. We have some unsettled business between us."
121759,,"My long hunt is finally over. Today, justice will be done!"
122102,Who shall be next to taste my blades?,
122570,Spirits! Sweep these mortals into the tides!!!,
122571,"All who summon the ferryman, must pay the toll!",
122572,You wish for passage to Helheim? Then you shall have it! Ahahahaha!,
122573,"Those who summon, pay the toll, forfeit now your eternal soul!",
122693,"You cannot hide what you truly are, demon!","You cannot hide what you truly are, demon!"
122695,Ahahahahaha!,
122845,,Praise to the goddess. She has blessed us this night with new life.
122846,,"The birth of not one, but two healthy males."
122864,Two?,
122865,,The Stormrage twins.
122866,,"Beautiful. Nearly identical, except for-"
122867,That one! His eyes are golden!,
122868,,Indeed. The child is destined for a great and prosperous future. His name... is Illidan.
122869,"Illidan, your anger is misplaced. I have not insulted you.",
122870,"You have cast me out, Cenarius!",
122871,"No. You may remain here, but I will no longer be your teacher.",
122872,So...,
122873,So I must learn from... a NOVICE... instead of a MASTER?,
122874,You must learn respect.,
122875,"To walk this path requires sacrifice, Illidan... Something you have yet to understand.",
122876,Brother-,
122877,Behold the Legion's power.,
122878,<Screams in agony>,
122879,"No matter how hard this world fights, it will fall.",
122880,Our eyes... deceive us.,
122881,Beyond this army is another... and another... and another...,
122882,"Even if we defeat them here, it will mean nothing.",
122883,We are doomed...,
122884,And I will find that way.,
122935,"If you wish to continue studying the wilds, you may do so with your brother.",
122943,Malfurion will become the first druid because he is a dedicated student. You... are NOT.,
123097,The army that marches on Azeroth is but a whisper of the Legion's true strength.,
123098,unless we find another way to fight them.,
123481,,Behold this motley throng in which the rebels put their faith.
123482,,"Kaldorei? You disgrace a glorious past, hiding in trees and cloaking yourselves in false piety. You have grown as savage as the trolls that skulk about your forests."
123483,,"Quel'dorei? You are peasants playing at nobility, all too willing to mingle with lesser races that dilute your bloodline. You are unworthy of the name high elves."
123484,,"Sin'dorei? Of all the elves, I thought you might understand the choice I made to save my people. Instead, you ally with misfits and monsters."
123485,,Each of you has debased your proud lineage. Each of you has forgotten the ancient power that is our birthright.
123486,,"But Suramar remembers! We are the Nightborne, last of the true elves. The rest of you are hollow echoes of our greatness."
123487,,Let this failed rebellion be a lesson to any that would stand against the shal'dorei!
123697,Your actions are illogical. All possible results for this encounter have been calculated.,
123912,"Enough of this weakness, boy! Contain your magic!",
123913,Too... much... power...,
123914,Father! No!,
123986,Another year of slumber. I wonder if Medivh will ever awaken.,
123987,Does our old friend dream? Is he trapped in nightmares?,
124000,Now you're ready to oversee the tower's protection in my absence.,
124001,Defense protocols activated.,
124002,"Hmm, I must remember to shut you down from time to time. Overuse might cause you to become... erratic.",
124016,"It couldn't have been helped, you know. We tried to alter it, but it was all part of a larger scheme.",
124017,I know. All part of a greater cycle. A cycle that now at last may be broken.,
124032,,"As you can see, the Legion's reach still extends beyond the Broken Shore."
124076,,"Their agents lurk across Azeroth, threatening to subvert our efforts at the tomb. They are some of the Legion's most powerful champions."
124077,"If the plans of these fiends come to fruition, all our efforts--all our sacrifices--will have been for naught.",
124078,We must enlist your help to hunt these targets down. You may be the only one with any chance of stopping them.,
124297,"Our power manifests: Kirin'var torel, ahm shalar, azakim!",
124298,,Together! We must all lend our strength!
124471,"Much has been asked of you in the course of this war, champion. I fear even more is needed.",
124588,Our friend lies just in here.,
124589,It breaks my heart to see him like this.,
124824,,Justice rains from above!
124825,,"Stay plucky, you will do better next time!"
124826,,You won on a wing and a prayer!
124827,,Swoop in!
124828,,It's a feathered frenzy!
124829,,Scratch that one.
126172,Wretched mortal! What have you done to my ship?!,
126173,No matter! You will pay for this... I WILL DEVOUR YOUR SOUL!,
126187,May I have your attention please. This ship is about to Self-Destruct. Please exit this ship at your soonest convenience.,
126189,My computer! How... how did you guess my password?! It had many symbols and capitalized letters!,
126286,Enough! I have little time for games!,
126857,Foolish mortals! Did you truly believe the Burning Legion would be so easily defeated?,
126866,Behold the power of the fel!,
126867,"Careful, champion. Something is emerging from the portal... something powerful!",
126926,"I... I live, but I'm in no condition for battle. Hurry, champion, you must stop him!",
126950,Let us begin.,Let us begin.
126951,Pitiful.,Pitiful.
126952,It seems you are ready.,It seems you are ready.
126953,Again!,Again!

126958,"Good, but can you do it again?","Good, but can you do it again?"
127010,,Cue awesome scene of the Fel Hammer destroying one of the Legion ships and the others jumping away!
127057,,"Be shielded, heroes!"
127161,,Odyn was a fool to choose you as his champion.
127162,,It will be amusing to see his shame when you fall.
127163,,"Your kind should not be here. This land is OURS, and only we are worthy of entering this tournament!"
127164,,I wonder if your name will be remembered after you've failed...
127165,Your size probably matches your strength. Puny.,
127166,"I'd let you work out with me, but these weights are as big as you. Come back when you grow muscles.",
127167,It's alright if you want to leave. Most of my opponents lose as soon as they look at me.,
127168,"I misjudged your strength, brul. I used to believe that size mattered, but perhaps I was mistaken.",

127269,It was my honor to be welcomed here by Odyn. I will prove his choice in my strength was not misjudged.,
127298,Battlelord $p's next opponent is Asrea Moonblade of the proud nightborne of Suramar.,
127299,Her blade has felled many a warrior inside this ring. Can the Battlelord find a way to triumph?,
127300,,It's been a while since my blade has tasted blood. I wonder if it will be pleased with yours...

127328,An excellent first round! It seems Damrul underestimated the strength of Battlelord $p.,
127329,The vaunted Steelhoof defense has fallen before $p's skill! But will that skill be enough to best the next challenger?,
127330,A melee for the ages! Asrea has been so dominant that many spectators considered her unbeatable. It would seem her hubris has ushered in her downfall!,

156725,<wheeze> I'm... sorry. I.. can't... I don't have anything... left in me...,
156728,"Miss Voss, <cough> please... bring me back... I must help my family... I'll do anything... anything...",
156729,,You'll be shunned if you become one of us. You look in a mirror and all you'll see is a monster.
156732,,We'll see. Maybe it can be different... just this one time.
156830,,Lilian Voss. Why have you called upon me?
156831,Lilian. We can find other tidesages. You know his family won't accept him.,
156832,,Bring this man back. He has been chosen to become Forsaken.
156833,,"As you command, by the will of the Dark Lady."

156980,"Finally, a challenger steps up!",
156981,How is this possible?!,
156982,This will not stand! You have not seen the last of Captain Hermes and his trio of ruthless crabs!,
156983,Looks like you need to seek some shell-ter. Get it? Shells? Crabs! Victory is mine!,
156984,Yeah! Crustacean power!,
157091,"Brothers and sisters, behold our glorious destiny!",
157150,I would... damn my soul... for all eternity... if it meant my family's happiness... please! You must...,
157151,You... must...,
157228,I... I live! Hahaha! I must see Julia and the children at once. They will be delighted!,
157229,,I guess we'll see what happens now.
157593,,The rumors are true. Daelin's Gate... has fallen.
157597,,A pirate fleet struck the gate with overwhelming force...
157598,Pirates?! The Proudmoores can't even protect us from pirates anymore!,
157600,,For shame!
157603,,But it has not been enough.
157605,,"Lady Ashvane has been my rock since those first dark days when we both lost our husbands. Now, she will be the kingdom's rock. Now... she is--"
157607,,A liar!
157608,,"So, this was your play all along. Despicable."
157609,,"What is the meaning of this, girl?!"
157611,,"Lady Priscilla Ashvane, you are under arrest for trafficking, conspiring with pirates, and high treason against the Admiralty of Kul Tiras."
157612,,Your company MADE the weapons that destroyed Daelin's Gate using this!
157613,,It's called Azerite... and the Alliance and Horde are already at war over it.
157614,,"You hired the pirate fleet, armed them to the teeth, and set them upon your own countrymen."
157616,,And I almost... Priscilla... How could you betray the kingdom? How could you betray me?
157617,,"You're too weak to rule, Katherine."
157621,"It's over, Stormsong! Look around you... You're surrounded!",
157622,"All I see are lost souls, crying for release.",

157961,"When one falls, another takes its place!",
157962,"One guy, three spiders, 26 total legs, you didn't have a chance.",

160407,,But my pets are infused with Azerite! It's what pets crave!
160408,,Score one for team Fizzie!
160409,,"That was my least favorite of the bunch, time to play with the real hard hitters, get ready!"
160410,"Just remember as we start this battle, you asked for this.",
160411,Bees are clearly superior. This proves it.,
160412,Not my bees! No!,
160413,Score one for the bees!,
160414,"Every time I train up new bees, it's always the same thing. They get big and strong and seemingly unbeatable, and then they sting something and die.",
160415,,"I've found the toughest sea creatures around to battle for me, you don't stand a chance."
160416,,Never a doubt in my mind.
160417,,"Always more fish in the ocean, right?  Maybe that's not what that saying means now that I think about it."
160418,,Looks like that one now sleeps with the fishes!
160419,,You're better suited to be chum on a fishing boat than battling for my team.
160420,,Strange creatures on this island will make for a strange battle I suspect.
160421,,You need much more training before you can handle a master like myself.
160422,,"This was not supposed to happen, the prophecy spoke otherwise."
160423,,Return to where you came from!
160424,,"Your determination is admirable, but the outcome of this has already been determined."
160425,If you want to beat the likes of me you're going to need a bigger boat to haul these out of here.,
160426,"One person against one shark, maybe an even fight.  One person against three? You're insane.",
160427,Big deal you beat me. I'm still stuck down here for eternity. At least I had a conversation today.,
160428,"Feeding time, boys!",
160429,The smell of blood in the water will just attract more sharks.,
160430,,"Before we start, I just want to remind you to not feel too bad when my team annihilates yours."
160431,,"Like I said in the beginning, my team is clearly superior."
160432,,Well this is most unexpected. You can bet I will be ready to win the next time we meet.
160433,,Annihilated!
160434,,Unexpected.
160435,"These little guys are pretty strange, but they sure pack a punch. Are you sure you want this fight?",
160436,"They have a lot of sharp pointy things and look mean, and you thought you could win?",
160437,"I should diversify my roster of pets now that I think about it.  Three of the same kind of pet, what was I thinking?",
160438,"Burly's Pet Battle Training Center.  I like the sound of that, and now I'm one step closer to beating you!",
160439,This is not the way this is supposed to be going. I'm supposed to be winning!,
160529,,We did it...  We actually did it!
160538,,"Still, they could be back. And if they bring those guns to bear on Boralus..."
160681,You trespass upon sacred ground.,
160682,What do we call you now?,

161007,,I will train and be prepared for the next time we meet.
161008,,Hah! Got one!

161015,Time to get down and battle! Lets do this!,
161016,"Another win for the best team, me!",
161018,"I hate losing! I'll be stronger next time, you can count on that.",
161021,Another one bites the dust.,
161022,You monster! That was my favorite pet.,
161023,"This place is spooky, lets make this a quick battle.",
161024,"It was a good fight, but you're no match for me.",
161025,"This place is cursed, I never lose that badly.",
161027,You had best take care of that before it's used for some blood ritual.,
161030,"That pet was a little creepy anyway, no big loss.",
161032,Time for a great adventure!,
161033,"I won? Excellent, I'll tell all my friends about this!",
161035,"Shucks, I hate losing.  Good fight.",
161036,"Good fight little guy, you'll get better!",
161037,Time to farm up some more pet bandages.,
161038,I always appreciate a good battle with a new challenger.,
161059,"With some extra practice you'd be a great challenge for even myself, keep at it.",
161060,"Astounding, I haven't lost a match in years.  Well fought!",
161064,"Victory is within my grasp, I can almost feel it.",
161066,"Do not cower in the face of defeat, rise up to the challenge if you can.",
161068,,"I'm on a winning streak, you have no chance against me and my team."
161069,,"Hooray, my winning streak increases!"
161070,,"This doesn't really count as a loss, I'm keeping my win streak."
161072,,Looks like my win streak is about to increase.
161074,,"I wasn't ready, this doesn't count!"
161077,,"I have not battled in a long while, I hope I am still a good challenge to you."
161080,,"My goodness, I guess I had a stronger team than I realized."
161082,,I guess I may be out of practice.
161084,,"Do not be sad about losing that one, your other pets look plenty strong."
161086,,"Do not worry little one, I will take care of you."
161087,,"The critters in this land are vicious, I hope you're ready for this."
161088,,"Like I said, the critters in this land are vicious.  Good fight either way."
161089,,"I need more time to train with these new species, I will be stronger when we next battle."
161090,,That's probably going to leave a scar.
161092,,"Maybe this isn't the strongest new species out here, I should keep looking for better things to capture."
161094,,You come to face me in my own home? Good luck.
161096,,Looks like I have an advantage on my home turf.
161097,,"This is most unexpected, I will win next time we meet, stranger."
161100,,"The species of Zandalar are unrivaled in power, your other pets stand no chance."
161103,,My pets only grow stronger when an ally falls in battle.
161612,,"I don't know what to do, Daelin. I don't know what to believe in... who to trust."
161613,,"Priscilla, the greatest friend of my heart... has stabbed me in it."
161614,,I have nothing... no one... left...

161616,,Jaina betrayed the kingdom.

162407,"We'll return, Liam.  I swear this to you.",
162408,,"You were a true man of the people, Liam.  Unlike any Royal I ever met.  We'll make them pay for this."
162409,"Gilneas will remember your courage forever, Liam.",
162416,,No one rides the Lady!

162627,"THREE? He woulda paid five, easy... Dummy!",
162691,,"Vol'jin, son of Sen'jin, once warchief of the Horde... Hear my voice and appear before us."

162693,"Vol'jin! Is it really you, my old friend?",
162694,Baine... ya heart beats strong and true... just like ya fadda. I be glad da demons didn't take ya.,
162695,Sylvanas led us to victory in the war against the Legion.,
162697,But since then... she has done much to strain the honor that binds the Horde together.,
162698,"I must know... when the voice spoke to you, bidding you to name her warchief... what spirit was it?",
162699,"Ah, my young friend. Death be... dark. Me memory... not be what it once was.",
162700,Was it Bwonsamdi? Did he crave the death she would bring?,
162701,"Da memory, it be denied me by da shadows. Shadows... dat... dat be comin' for ya! Watch out!",
162719,"You're the last of your tribe with any sense left.  As a reward for giving us Prince Nadun, I grant you the gift that is your birthright and more!",

162743,"Da truth dat it might not be da loa who wanted Sylvanas to be warchief, but somethin' far more powerful.",
162744,"Ahhhh, ya come back. Did ya find da spirit of Vol'jin? Or ya here ta make a deal?",
162745,,"Loa of death, your servant Vol'jin has called to you. Yet you have turned a deaf ear to his pleas."
162746,"What? Nonono. Ya be mistaken, Talanji.",
162747,Speak plainly! Was it you who urged Vol'jin to name Sylvanas warchief?,
162748,"Mind ya tone, bull-mon... or ya be talkin' with ya father soon enough.",
162749,"Why would me want da Banshee Queen in charge? Nononono. Sure, I be all for war and death, but dat Sylvanas... she be tippin' da scales too far.",
162750,"Balance be important! Besides, dat one got a nasty habit of keepin' what she kills. No, ya warchief be no friend to ol' Bwonsamdi.",
162751,Lich King. Da voice I heard as I be dyin'... tellin' me to name Sylvanas warchief... was it yours?,
162752,The Banshee Queen's schemes threaten the balance. I had no hand in them.,
162753,And me spirit bein' trapped in dis world... is dat your doin'?,
162754,Vol'jin... your soul has walked on the Other Side and returned. You have been altered... more than you know.,
162755,Is it you who be trappin' me soul in dis world? Ta jail me like ya jail da Scourge?,
162756,You are neither undead nor damned. You do not belong here. Leave this place at once.,
162757,,I do not like de look of dis. I suggest we go... quickly!
162758,Leave now or stay forever. The choice is yours.,
162759,,"Minions of the Banshee Queen, leave this place or die."
162761,,Hold... you DARE bring a priestess of Bwonsamdi into MY halls?
162762,"Eyir, speak with me if da others not be to your liking.",
162763,,Hmm. Very well. You and your champion may approach. But know that deception will be met with destruction.
162764,"Queen of da val'kyr. My spirit was sent to da Other Side, den returned. Was dis your doing?",
162765,,"Shadow hunter, you are no longer a mere spirit. What you have become is something beyond my power to forge."
162766,Who be havin' such power? Could it be da same one who bid me ta name Sylvanas warchief?,
162767,,You have been touched by the hand of valor. Such a noble force does not scheme for mortal thrones.
162768,So whoever whispered to me's not da same as who sent me back?,
162769,,"You have been granted all the knowledge I am willing to share. Leave now, and never return."
162778,"Free... at last.  Your reward will be substantial, friends.",
162779,,"This is the most moronic... half-assed... ridiculous plan you've ever come up with, Budd!"
162783,,But I suppose it's the only plan we've got.
162785,,What am I grabbing again?
162787,"Your approach is... unorthodox.  Though, I suppose with the smoke from the fires, all they'll see is your silhouettes.",
162809,LOOK AT ME!!!!  I'M A MANATAUR!!!,
162812,,"Shut your stupid face, Budd.  SHUT IT!!"
162814,Let's go!,
162846,,Zuldazar requires additional forces along de coast!
162848,,Our vintner refuses to work with the staff you have provided.
162849,,De naga have been advancing on Zuldazar's shores. We must push dem back before dey pose a greater threat!
162851,,"Baine sent assistants to Suramar to aid with our arcwine production, but managing them has proven... difficult."
162854,"Though I am honored by your request to join us, I am afraid that I must decline.",
162855,Meeting the needs of our current allies has stretched the Horde thin. It would be unwise for us to take your people under our wing.,
162856,"[DNT] You understand, don't you?",
162857,"But please, enjoy the hospitality of Orgrimmar as our guests. Horde or not, the vulpera will always be welcome here.",
162858,"[DNT] Now, where were we?",
162862,,We must all do our part.
162863,Baine must act before things get worse.,
162867,,"Zuldazar has sent de Horde our finest warriors, but at what cost? Our coastlines are left defenseless. 

De naga have been advancing along de southern shores. Their presence causes me great concern. 

De Horde must protect its allies! Especially those dat cannot defend themselves."
162868,"I oversee all war-related construction. 

The Horde has new outposts going up all over Azeroth. 

Things were going as planned, until work at the Crushblow camp came to a stop. 

The peons just disappeared! 

We won't meet our deadlines unless Baine does something.",
162869,,"Since joining the Horde, we've been asked to increase our arcwine production. 

Baine was kind enough to send us some help, but unfortunately, it's had the opposite effect. 

I'm not sure what can be done..."
162870,"Nisha, head for Zuldazar and do what you do best.",
162871,"Meerah, can you sort things out with the vintner in Suramar?",
162872,Good. Let's get to work.,
162873,,Those naga won't know what hit 'em!

174772,"The whispers from the deep call to me, but I have been hearing whispers for far longer than this. My things are all that matter to me now!",
174778,Fools! Did you think I would retreat so easily after your puny ritual?,
174781,The Tarragrue? I hoped you would get deeper into the Maw before that beast caught your scent.,
174783,"Be wary. It moves slowly, but if you tarry for too long, it will find you!",
174799,,Hand over the Eye of Fire and we will not be required to take it by force.
174800,You still stand. Your little ritual actually managed to weaken me.,
175117,I've got him free!,
175118,,Stay close. I'll get us out.
175119,,Thrall...
175120,The Alliance? Here?,
175121,Our king sent us to rescue his friend.,
175122,We too have come to save Baine.,
175123,,His odds will improve if we work together.
175124,Hmm... Agreed.,
175125,Time is short. Let's move.,
175191,Baine!,
175192,Th--Thrall? Jaina?,
175193,These chains are warded against magic. I'll need time to pick the lock.,
175194,This feels wrong. Sylvanas must have known we were coming.,
175195,"Indeed she did, traitor. You and Lady Proudmoore.",
175196,,I have no quarrel with you.
175197,"Have you forgotten the purge of Dalaran, murderer?  Today, the Sunreavers will be avenged.",
175198,,"Then your vendetta is with me, and me alone!"
175199,No! You will watch your friends die--just as I did!,
175200,Rangers! Kill them all! FOR THE SUNREAVERS!,

175386,Can you get us to safety?,
175387,,She is... preventing teleportation...
175388,Jaina... we need a way out!,
175389,,She's... blocking teleportation...
175391,,I will hold the waters at bay... so long as I remain entertained.
175398,,It is done. The way is open.
175399,,Azshara's reign must end.
175406,,Be quiet!
175571,,You face far greater forces than you know.

175665,It is safe to assume that the naga are maintaining an arsenal of these weapons.,
175666,"If we can determine where they are being stored, we can seize them for ourselves and arm our allies.",
175667,Oculeth has devised a method to detect trace amounts of Azerite. Provide him with whatever he needs to do so.,
175669,,You! Get away from that!
175686,Incompatible presence detected!,

175691,Gimme that gnome!,
175692,"Hey, Brighteyes! Over here!",
175693,"Phew! Looks like you handled that situation, boss!",
175694,Good thing we kept one around. Now we've got a lead on the next location!,
175695,Hah! This has gotta pay off!,
175696,Unworthy?! I hand-picked these tinkologists myself!,
175697,They're the best and the brightest!,
175698,Th-This can't be right! It's malfunctioning!,
175699,,Amazing! The expedition has been saved by the Tinkmaster's technological expertise.

175796,"Behold, the true power of the Eye of Fire!",
176255,"Hah! I know fully well how to reverse your little spells. When I return, you will be reduced to cinders.",

176600,"Ah, looks like an intruder activated my arcane trap! You poor fool, you simply had no chance against my genius.",
176610,This arcane lock is fiendishly difficult if you don't... you know what... you don't need to hear it. It'll probably just confuse your infantile mind. Ha!,

176655,"If we are to push further into Azshara's realm and obtain the Tidestone, we will need to know the lay of the land.",
176656,,Obtaining the Tidestone must be our top priority. But it would be unwise to press further into Azshara's realm without first knowing what we're up against.
176719,"Hold onto the gryphons, they're trained to avoid all sorts of danger. Hopefully it also includes fire from a dragon's artifact!",
176720,I'm gonna get meself to Camp Bronzebeard te see how they're doin'. I'll meet up with the rest of ye later!,
176721,We'll have to leap off the gryphons when we get to the camp and get to work as fast as possible with whoever is left there.,
176722,I'm goin' ahead te make sure Camp Bronzebeard is safe. For the Alliance!,
176723,The recruits back at Stormwind are never going to believe this!,
176724,"Let's hope whoever has the shield up lets us in, or this will be one short ride!",
176725,Hang on!,

177382,,Behold the wonders of Nazjatar.
177681,,Amazing!

177810,,"But despite all I taught them, they stubbornly clung to hope. To life."
177811,,"My bargain with Azshara will yet bear fruit. The armies of Azeroth will fight her master, and he will line their streets with corpses."

177886,Ouch! That stung.,
177887,All according to plan.,
177891,I will remember this when we meet again.,
177892,There we go! Ye can use that console tae connect us tae the Chamber of Heart.,

178008,Impressive! Most impressive!,
178011,You defeated my lock! Unbelievable!,
178012,"My lock, defeated? Well, this was one of my more 'basic' models.",
178014,"Enjoy your success, looter. My other treasures are far more secure.",
178015,Haha! You'll never steal my treasures!,
178016,"Don't feel bad, you never had a chance.",
178017,"Begone, looter!",
178228,[DNT] I know of your kind. Your people aided the Horde with our efforts on Zandalar.,
178229,"[DNT] Please, come forward. What can I do for you?",
178236,"[DNT] I do not disagree, but taking on new allies now, when we cannot address the needs of our current allies would be unwise.",
178403,,"Ah, Jaina. What a relief to see you safe."
178404,,"Hello, Calia. Big brother."
178405,Word has spread of what happened at Orgrimmar. Is the war finally over?,
178406,,"It will take time for all the pockets of fighting to be quelled, but... yes, I believe so."
178407,,"Azeroth has seen so many wars, so much strife. I pray we have earned a respite."
178408,,"As do I. Have you been able to find peace in your own heart, Derek?"
178409,"I still have some rough seas to sail, but I'm much better now, thanks to Calia. Without her guidance, I would have been truly lost.",
178410,,"I'm so grateful you brought us together, Jaina. This time with Derek has helped me as much as it's helped him."
178411,,"In the wake of this war, others will need to find their footing. Their future. Perhaps you could guide them, too."
178412,,I'm not sure how much help I could be. I don't have all the answers.
178413,Maybe they don't need answers. Maybe they just need hope. Like I did.,
178414,,"Well said, big brother. Come, let's take a walk. I am so grateful to have you both back in my life."
178439,Sasha's snout says this is the place. Maybe they're in one of these houses?,
178440,Let's get moving. The peons can't be far.,
178441,Head inside and check things out. I'll keep watch.,
178544,"We will take your soul, and raise the dragon from the dead!",
178545,The full force of the Alliance will rain down upon you!,
178644,As a newly arrived soul you should know this is a place of torment and of penance.,
178645,"Not to fear though, for as you see by these many sinstones, the road to redemption is possible.",
178649,,Let's go. Those monsters have my son.
178650,Henry? I didn't see him... but I'm sure he's still alive.,
178651,"Each of these sinstones represents a soul who has come to this place and cleansed themselves of their sins, eventually moving on from here or accepting the role of a venthyr.",
178652,"Final judgement comes from the Master. It is he who commands this place. It is he who embraces souls to become venthyr, the tormentors and eaters of sin.",
178653,There are always those few who are unwilling to work for redemption.,
178654,Or don't agree with their sinstone.,
178655,Or are simply just a bunch of bad apples.,
178656,Thems get the boot. Down to the Maw and never to come back. Take this poor soul for example. He's on his final warning.,
178657,Won't even admit he did somethin' wrong. Still thinks he's someone important.,
178667,"Hold, creatures. This is a guest, not a charge.",
178668,"Quick, make yaself presentable. Lord Chamberlain is here.",
178791,Mother... I'm sorry. I tried to fight the ogres... but they were too strong.,
178792,,"Henry... always remember that you are more than your mistakes. Now, Private Garrick, I want a full situation report."
178793,"Yes, mother--Captain Garrick! The ogres are using necromancy to raise a dragon from the dead.",
178794,They need sacrifices like us to fuel their magic. They're about to start a ritual that--,
178796,It's already begun... they're going to use the life force they gathered to reanimate the dragon!,
178893,"That's far enough, orc! Dismount and submit or die!","That's far enough, orc! Dismount and submit or die!"
178894,,"Out of our way, fools!"
178896,"My children, I know the suffering you have endured.",
178897,The shortage of anima and the lack of new souls have inflicted terrible hardship upon us all.,
178898,I fear further sacrifices must be made if Revendreth is to survive this crisis.,
178899,Ah! The mortal who escaped the inescapable prison. A living soul restoring hope to the realms eternal.,
178901,This drought has left my people desperate...,
178902,"But if you were to aid our cause, then I could gratefully provide the aid you seek.",
178904,Begging my Master's pardon.,
178905,Ravagers and thieves. Stop them before they raid what few anima reserves we have left.,

179762,We face this challenge with dignity and remain united behind the Master. Revendreth remains resolute!,
179763,They claim he is hoarding aether when in fact he must ration what limited reserves we have left.,
179764,Rumors of a rebellion are greatly overstated. Everything is under control.,
179765,Lord Chamberlain! There's a commotion up ahead. Looks like a fight.,
179766,Rebels. Just drive either over or through them. They would not dare to-  Aah!,

179768,Aaaaaaaaah!,
179769,Aaaaaaaah!,

179789,,"Hmm, I don't know if that's the best use of Mida's talents..."
179790,,"Seems like a good fit! Goblins can acquire anything, at any time."
179791,,While words of encouragement are always welcome...
179792,,"Uh, are you sure about that? Have you seen the size of his hooves?"
179793,,Wise choice. Highmountain Tauren are really strong!

179795,,More like sleeping on the fruit...
179796,,Good call. Nomi is well known for his culinary creations.

179847,"[DNT] Without your assistance, our troubles might have consumed us.",

179849,"[DNT] If you still wish to join our ranks, you would be most welcome within the Horde.",
179860,,Am I glad to see you! These naga are relentless.
179880,,Impudent dragon. All of your kind will bow before N'Zoth!

180894,,Time for us to get outta here. See you back in Orgrimmar.
180896,,Why don't the Horde want us?
180897,,Sure is good to be out of the sand.
180898,,So we'll need to prove ourselves to the Horde? That shouldn't be a problem.

180956,"I'd say we're making progress, $p.",

184528,"To the west, another threat looms.",
184529,"Though we suspect they hail from Ahn'Qiraj, they are unlike any qiraji or silithid we have faced before.",
184530,"And worst of all, our priests are plagued by unrelenting nightmares.",
184531,I fear that these visions are but the harbinger of something far more dire.,

184535,"With the attention of the Golden Lotus divided, the mogu clearly see an opportunity to conquer the Vale and subjugate everyone within.",
184536,"Most troubling of all... though the Vale has been cleansed of the sha's corruption, a tangible sense of dread lingers in the air.",
184537,The Highkeeper speaks of a looming threat that we are powerless to stop. I cannot draw him out of his malaise.,
184548,Hah! Our dragon will crush them!,
184565,,Initiating query for suitable alternatives. Standby...
184736,The Alliance has sent word. They have agreed to the armistice. This bitter war is finally over.,
184737,At last we can begin to heal our wounded Earth Mother... and the wounded Horde as well.,
184738,"One question remains. Who will serve as warchief? Perhaps, you, Thrall, would--",
184739,No. I told Saurfang I would not lead the Horde again.,
184740,But perhaps the question is not who should become warchief... but whether there should be one at all.,
184744,Though the Horde has changed through the years--for good or ill--we have always looked to a warchief to guide us forward.,
184745,That legacy must end. The war nearly cost us everything. There is no place for a warchief in a time of peace.,
184746,"It is true--the Horde has changed. Our ranks have grown, and new voices have stepped forth to lead.",
184747,"This is what makes us strong. All of us, building a new future--together.",
184799,"The armistice is signed. At long last, the Fourth War is over.",
184800,,No. Not while the Black Moon still cries out for vengeance. Not until the Horde has answered for its treachery.
184801,Further bloodshed will not bring back the fallen. We must renew our hope and forge a future for those who survived.,
184802,,"And when the next warchief musters an army, will hope save you if it is Stormwind that burns?"
184803,"I know it's difficult to trust, but there are signs of change within the Horde.",
184804,,"Your faith is naive, lion son. I will sign no treaty unless it is written in the Banshee's blood!"
184806,"There is truth in her words, Anduin.",
184807,"When that day comes, no scrap of parchment will hold them back.",
184808,"The path to peace will not be easy, and not all will choose to walk it.",
184809,It has to.,
185187,I have been training pets longer than almost any other living being. Do not underestimate me.,
185190,My tactics and strategy are unmatched. Do not feel bad when you inevitably lose.,
185192,"A lucky strike, my retaliation will be swift.",
185195,"You did not stand a chance, my pets are top tier.",
185197,Astonishing! Perhaps there are still some tricks I can learn.,
185198,"Calculations complete, victory is guaranteed.",
185200,"How did you plan on winning? I know all of your moves, I'm practically cheating.",
185201,"Inconceivable! I'm not worried, this is all still part of my great plan. Just wait and see, your doom is impending.",
185202,Calculated.,
185214,"Whether I win or lose, I hope it's quick.",
185215,"Finally, maybe I can take a vacation now.",
185216,"Whatever, I'm tired of all of this work.",
185217,"Finally, something is going the way I want it to.",
185218,That wasn't even my strongest pet. You'll be sorry for that.,
185219,,It's time to crush some skulls!
185220,,"I told you I am the strongest and that I would crush you, so I did."
185221,,Looks like my pets need to train as much as I do.
185223,,"Yeah, CRUSHED!"
185225,,My sweet pet! I will avenge you!
185226,,We meet in battle at last. Feel the wrath of the COUNCIL OF CHAOS!
185227,,"I must admit, I'm disappointed. You meddled in our affairs so much, and yet you are defeated so easily."
185228,,It appears I have greatly underestimated you.
185229,,"Our victory is imminent, our plans about to unfold!"
185230,,"We will not fail, that is merely a small setback."
185231,,"Neural link at maximum strength, time to unleash some mayhem!"
185232,,"My genius is unmatched, my greatest creation cannot be stopped!"
185233,,"Years of planning and work and masterful engineering, now just a pile of scrap. My next project is starting with a giant laser instead of all of this random junk."
185234,,WOW! Power spike!
185235,But this relentless quest for perfection nearly brought us to ruin.,
185236,We can improve ourselves without losing our individuality in the process.,
185237,"Together, we will forge a brighter future. For the Alliance!",
185953,I shall tear this world apart!,
186141,No more excuses. The Master will have his tithe of anima or I will see to it that everyone in this miserable hamlet are exiled to the Ember Ward.,
186153,Your world... is MINE.,
186154,Yer a child o' Azeroth!,
186155,"Through your flesh, my Black Empire is reborn.",
186224,"Hold on, champion!",
186303,"There, the link is up.",
186424,It is imperative that they be kept away from the Forge.,
186425,Terrible monstrosities have emerged from the sands and gather in great numbers.,
186426,They see our cities burning to ash and our people turning against each other.,
186427,We must prepare ourselves for disaster.,
186545,The final truth given form.,
186546,Behold... Ny'alotha.,
186547,We're bein' overrun! There's no way we can beat 'em all!,
186548,There is always a way.,
186549,"Save our world, champion. No matter the cost.",
186619,Her strength... is your strength!,
186715,I did not realize they had grown so bold as to invade Mogu'shan Vaults.,
186717,The rise of their new empress must have spurred them to action.,
186720,Perhaps you will fare better.,
186776,For the vulpera... and for the Horde!,
186799,"In place of a warchief, there is now a council led by Baine, Thrall, and the others. I believe they can--",
186800,"But this is the only way to build a better future. I believe it will work, Genn.",
186801,"Peace may be on the table today, but soon enough the Horde will sound their drums and march for war.",
186838,Shattered!,Shattered!
186847,We're gonna lose the chamber! There's no way tae stop him!,
187550,,"Grubby, I'm so glad I got to see you before I go. Goodbye, my sweet little friend."
187552,Before you go? What do you mean?,
187553,,Only a vessel of Ardenweald can contain the power of the grove.
187554,"Willow, you... YOU are the vessel?!",
187555,No! There must be another way!,
187556,,"Don't be sad for me, Pelagos. I've spent my whole life serving the forest. This is my chance to help all of the Shadowlands!"
187557,Willow... thank you. Bastion will never forget what you have given us. I will make certain of it.,
187946,,This place already feels like home.
187948,"In these moments of calm, I can't help but wonder what new adventures await.",
188262,RUN!!!,
188266,"Dead end! Well, time to see if this amulet works.",
188690,Darkness awaits you!,Darkness awaits you!
189144,Master! Master! The creature has arrived!,
191076,,I know. I raised him to overcome any challenge.
191087,We have other rituals to oversee. Savor the final moments of your life!,
191113,,"Then we need to move quickly. Recruit, Private Garrick, the Alliance never gives up hope, even in the face of disaster."
191114,,We'll put a stop to these rituals before the ogres can complete them. Let's go!
191458,My Prince!,
191459,Theotar! My old friend. I am so happy to see you. And I see you managed to get your shirt off...,
191460,You as well. I could grate carrots on those ribs of yours.,
191461,I sent out the call to any who survived. We have quite a gathering collecting here.,
191620,,Renathal.
191621,Accuser. Thank you for sending this Maw Walker to find us.,
191622,,Curator...
191623,,I am fine. I will be fine.
191667,My liege.,
191682,Draven! This is more than I could have hoped for. Report.,
191683,"At Theotar's request, we moved what remains of our forces here to Sinfall.",
191684,There are far less of us than we had in our last assault.,
191685,"Gather the forces, we attack soon. I have a plan, but we must act swiftly before Denathrius learns of my escape.",

193028,The bargain between Denathrius and the Jailer will leave us all to be consumed by the Maw.,
193029,"I want our ways to survive. If that makes me selfish, I would hope you are all selfish as well.",
193030,You mean YOU could seize control. These are merely the ravings of a selfish prince desperate to reclaim his former glory.,
193033,,None of your grand words matter. You cannot defeat both the Jailer and the Master.
193034,,But I must agree with the others. You lack... leverage.
193035,I've heard enough. This usurper demands our medallions but offers nothing.,
193036,,I will not subject my stoneborn children to further suffering.

194306,,You deprive your own people of anima and inflict a drought upon all of the Shadowlands!

195178,,You speak for Revendreth? Where is your sire? Where is our brother Denathrius?
195179,My sire... has betrayed us all.,
195180,"The drought was his doing. He stole the very lifeblood of our realms, starving his own people... and yours as well.",
195181,"When his lies were exposed, Denathrius unleashed his vast coffers of anima into the Maw... to fuel the might of his true master.",
195182,,"Long ago, we stood as one to imprison that... monster."
195183,,"With the Primus gone and Denathrius a traitor, our pantheon has been broken... and doom comes for the Shadowlands."
195184,There is yet hope. This mortal saved me from the Maw and revealed the sire's treachery.,
195186,,"They aided my forest as well. Their kind has shown great potential. If focused, it could turn the tide in our favor."
195187,,"Agreed. For the good of the Shadowlands, each mortal must choose a covenant."
195189,,"And when our realms have regained their strength, we will stand together against the darkness."
195190,,"I will see it done, Eternal Ones. With her voice have I spoken."
195192,,"Come, mortal. The hour of decision is at hand."

195681,I humbly present... the Maw Walker.,
195682,"Maw Walker, I am aware of your urgent request for anima. Under normal circumstances, I would of course oblige.",
195683,"Sadly, you arrive in the midst of a violent rebellion. Our resources are stretched perilously thin.",

196055,You won't... succeed...,
196056,,Such a narrow vision. You disappoint me.
196057,,No matter. We will find what we seek... in another.
196062,These bonds are too strong to break by force. We must find a way to free him.,

196389,,Mother... I tried to stop the ogres on my own. But I failed. My strength was not enough.
196390,,"Shuja, the Horde is strong not when we fight alone, but when we stand united. Now, tell me what's happened here."
196391,,As you command. The ogres are using necromancy to raise a dragon from the dead.
196392,,They need sacrifices like us to fuel their magic. They're about to start a ritual that will --
196393,,It's already begun. They're going to use the life force they've gathered to reanimate the dragon!
196394,,"Then we must take action. Remember that when we band together, the Horde can conquer any challenge."

217980,"Now kids, we've talked about how dangerous gnolls are. He may look cute now, but when he grows up-",
217981,,"No, Ta, look! Scaps loves fish now!"
217982,FEESH YUMMY! SCAPS EAT FEESH!,FEESH YUMMY! SCAPS EAT FEESH!
217983,,"See, Ta? Scaps just needs fish! If we take care of him, he can be a good gnoll!"
217984,"... Alright, we'll take him in, for now. But don't be surprised when he runs off or tries to bite you...",
218312,,Let's get started!
218336,,"Wrathion, you have my gratitude."
218337,I trust your flight will now assist us in claiming the Obsidian Citadel from the djaradin.,
218338,,Of course we will... after we see to the safety of the eggs.
218340,,"You do not know her as I do, young one."
218342,Our future? Or yours?,
218344,The Obsidian Citadel was built to defend all of the Dragon Isles.,
218345,,"I would have expected you to care more for the protection of helpless eggs, Wrathion."
218346,Stay then.,
218349,Surely they are secure now that Raszageth has been driven away.,
218351,,"For now, we must remain at the Life Pools and safeguard our future."
218352,You cannot abandon the legacy of my flight to the hands of our enemies.,
218353,"Tend to what matters most to your flight, and I will save what matters most to mine.",
218360,"It was an honor to stand with you, my Queen.",
218361,,She is an unpredictable foe.
218362,,"Your aid was... unexpected, but appreciated."
218377,Stay as long as you like.,
218403,,"We were hoping you would join us, friends. A chieftain's return to the sea is a celebration for all."
218404,"If you... don't mind me asking, how did he pass? Was it the gnolls?",
218407,,"Oh no, Kalecgos. It was simply his time. Ponoliak was a stubborn old coot, but even he had to succumb to age eventually."
218408,,"Not all deaths are violent, dear friend."
218409,To be honest... I can't remember a time when they weren't.,
218425,,You're leaving? The celebration has only just begun!
218426,Thank you Brena--and everyone. I have learned more than I imagined in my short time in your company.,
218427,"Despite tragedy, you all remain kind and resolute. Because of your community. Because of family.",
218428,"The power the blue dragonflight is missing is not ley lines, or ancient artifacts... it's family.",
218429,"I must go to them. But if you ever have need of me, simply call. I will hear you. And I'll come as swiftly as my wings can carry me.",
218430,It is time for the blue dragons to once more be the guardians of this land.,
218431,,... I... I see.
218432,,Hmph. You could have said something about being a dragon from the beginning! Seems an important detail to leave out.
218433,,"Well, you'd best be back any time you need a good meal. There will always be a warm bowl of soup for you here, Kalec."
218434,"I look forward to it. Take care, Brena, Norukk... everyone.",
218584,,Child... you cannot show any mercy to Raszageth. She has made her choice.
218585,I understand.,
218586,,"No, you do not. You have a kind soul... I know you hesitate at the thought of fighting any more of your own kind."
218587,,"I... showed too much mercy, once. Twice. Many times. Before long... it was too late."
218588,You speak of Neltharion's betrayal.,
218589,,"Do not make my mistake, young one. There can be no mercy... without justice. Remember that."
218590,"Thank you, Sindragosa. I will.",
218591,,"... I hope you truly do, my dear."
218622,"Please, return to the Azure Archives. Sindragosa is awaiting our return--and we should be able to reclaim the oathstone.",
218623,Sindragosa? She has returned from the grave?,
218624,I'll explain on the way. Let's go!,
218625,And I thought I had seen it all in my old age...,
218628,,"Looks like I can check off ""get an adventurer te go te Camp Nowhere"" from the list!"
218629,,I better hit the ol' dusty trail te the folks over at Three-Falls Lookout.
218630,,... or was it Theron's Watch?
218631,,"No, it was Three-Falls Lookout."
218632,,"... ach! Caddy, get it together! Three-Falls Lookout is THAT way!"
218736,,It has been ten thousand years since the dragons were last in the Isles. They are invaders upon your land. Join the Primalists. Embrace the storm. We will aid you in the battles to come.
218737,"Are you, too, not invaders? The Khanam Matra welcomes the dragons to our Khural. Take your leave. The storm has no place in the lands of Ohn'ahra.",
218739,,"Your Khanam Matra leads you to servitude. We offer a future of strength. When you see your error, we will be waiting."
218917,,"And you, of course, $n. I cannot thank you enough. I hope you will make yourself at home and know that you always have a family in Iskaara."
218968,,"Let's be off. We will do what we can to aid you, once we uncover the source of this rot."
218969,Judging by the gnoll's sudden aggression... I fear for the inhabitants of the trading outpost.,
218970,,Norukk! Get out of your head and get a move on!
218971,"Yes, yes. Coming!",
219188,"-And both waste our resources and get himself killed! Please, Gleamfisher, talk sense into him.",
219189,,"You will need the blessings of the Spirits of Wind and Water, as well. My children's children, you will need to work together to prove yourselves to them. I am certain you can do it."
219355,Cindrethresh!,
219356,,Zury!
219357,Have you found the Earth-Warder?,
219358,,No. He is not in this chamber.
219359,,But there is--
219360,...A different dragon.,
219361,"Come forth, loyal servants of Malygos!",
219362,,"Well, this should be fun!"
219369,,Those vermin sought to disrupt our ritual!
219370,They are unworthy of the dragon blood in their veins!,
219371,They mean nothing. Leave them.,
219372,The elements have granted me the power I need.,
219566,Did you hear?,
219567,,Hear what?
219568,A drake tells me that the Trueborn are on the move. Something important is about to happen!,
219569,,Truly?
219570,"I do not know the details, but... he is close to finding it. Soon he will have the power to put the flights in their place... as they deserve.",
219571,,Shhhh! Do not let the Scalesworn hear you speak like that!
219806,What do you mean? Commander Eranog said it would be here.,
219807,,"I have not seen him. Come to think of it, I have not seen anyone from South Hold come by today. Very strange."
219911,,"Greetings, brother. Any news?"
219912,"A delay, unfortunately. They are still looking for it at South Hold Gate.",
219913,,Still?! Should they not have found it by now?
219914,I am sure everything will be handled by the time our benefactors are ready. He will make sure of it.,
219923,,Careful! We speak too casually. There are unfamiliar faces about.
221180,,My apologies. There is nothing here awaiting you.
221369,Enough! Take the vault! I will liberate the Storm-Eater!,
221563,"During the dark days of the Cataclysm, the Aspects made great sacrifices to save our world.",
221564,"I am pleased that you have accepted our invitation to the Dragon Isles, Lord Commander.",
221565,The Alliance will answer the call and stand together with dragonkind once again.,
221568,,Just think of all the ancient knowledge we can discover together!
221569,"The Dragon Isles is our home, not a place for outsiders to plunder.",
221571,Splendid! You two have found common ground already.,
221572,"Now then, let us begin preparations for our voyage.",
221596,Alexstrasza shall be most appreciative.,
221597,Though she will insist that you do not bring any... lingering conflicts to her shores.,
221601,"You have my word that this will be an expedition, not a military maneuver.",
221602,"To honor our truce with the Horde, I have instructed the Explorers' League to work in concert with the Reliquary.",
221603,"The dracthyr will accompany the Alliance on this journey, but it will take time to build trust between us.",
221605,"As a fellow soldier, I share your wariness, Azurathel.",
221919,Spirits of Azeroth! Gather your strength! Gather your rage! Now is the hour of your vengeance!,
222032,,"What is the meaning of this, Sabellian? Where are the eggs?"
222034,"Yes, why don't you explain how your ridiculous plan destroyed the future of an entire flight?",
222036,"I apologize for any misunderstandings, Life-Binder. But any report of our extinction is premature.",
222037,"The eggs were never in danger. The cart, and my presence, were merely to draw the attention of our foes and allow my clutch to move unobserved.",
222060,"I have spent millennia rebuilding my flight. As Neltharion's heir I pledge it, and myself, to you.",
222061,What are you--,
222062,,"These eggs are most welcome here, Sabellian. But your part in your father's twisted legacy has earned you no such privilege."
222064,"I will not argue that I aided my father as my duty demanded of me. But when the enormity of his betrayal became clear, I scorned his evil and turned myself to rebuilding a new Black Dragonflight, free from his corruption. It is this I put before you now.",
222065,,"I will ensure the eggs are cared for, but I will not be involved in your bickering. That is for the black, not the red, to decide."
222070,"Do you play me for a fool, old man!?",
222071,"You play yourself, whelp. Have no fear though, you will understand your place in time. Youth makes fools of us all.",
222080,"You dare bring that outsider here. You insult Ohn'ahra, Balakar Khan! Step away from this path!",
222081,The Nokhud deserve the power of the storm! We will show the Maruuk how far they have fallen.,
222082,,"My khan, this interloper has no place amongst your Nokhud. We must cleanse ourselves of any weakness."
222088,"See those stone pillars? They are part of a barrier that keeps anyone from approaching. We must protect them, or the island's defenses will fall.",
222230,,"Do you see? Those pylons empower Koroleth's destructive power. If we cannot stop her, she will destroy the pillar, and the ward that protects the Ancient Bough will fall!"
222260,The Aspects will be pleased that the Council has accepted their invitation.,
222261,The Dragon Isles hold great wonders... and many perils.,
222264,The strength of the Horde has always been its people.,
222265,I am heartened to hear it.,
222266,But know that the Dragon Queen will not abide conflict on her shores.,
222268,The Horde honors its truce with the Alliance.,
222269,"To that end, the Reliquary will work together with the Explorers' League on an expedition of discovery.",
222270,,I expect we will learn much from one another.
222271,,"Do not forget, Ebyssian, that the Dragon Isles are home to the dracthyr as well."
222272,,We intend to rediscover our past... and lay claim to our future.
222273,,"Then let our peoples make this journey together, Cindrethresh."
222275,,"Agreed. Along the way, we can hone your combat skills... despite your obvious lack of wings."
222276,I see there is much work ahead of us.,
222281,,I was expecting Malygos. Where is he? And who are you?
222282,Kalecgos... And you--you cannot possibly be...,
222283,,"Sindragosa? In a way. A simulacrum, created by her in order to preserve her memories and knowledge."
222284,,It would seem a great deal of time has passed since she left.
222285,Yes. And much has happened.,
222287,,I sense an Aspect.
222288,It's a long story. Both you and Malygos... are gone.,
222289,,I see. And the rest of our flight? Where are they?
222290,,...tell me.
222291,"After Neltharion betrayed us, we were on the verge of extinction.",
222292,We few who remain are scattered. Aimless and... alone.,
222293,,Yet you came here. That tells me you still have hope for our kin.
222294,,"Child of my flight, shall we work together to make that hope a reality?"
222295,Nothing would give me more pleasure.,
222296,What must we do?,
222302,,You treasured us all. May the seas find you as worthy as we do.
222303,,Look...
222304,,Gral himself has chosen Ponoliak! What a life!
222305,"I... forgive me, I don't understand.",
222307,How can you find such joy in the passing of family?,
222308,,"It is not that we are not sad for his passing, Kalec."
222309,,"But in celebrating his life, he shall remain with us forever."
222310,,"What better way to strengthen the bonds of the family that remains, than celebrating all who came before?"
222424,"At long last, the Mistress of the Storm shall be free!",
222425,The order is given. Attack!,
222426,Ebon Scales! Strike as one!,
222427,,These cultists speak of unleashing a storm.
222428,"The threat is greater than you know, young ones.",
222429,,Why should we trust you?
222430,Neltharion?,
222431,It seems there is... much you do not know.,
222432,"I am Ebyssian, and this is Wrathion.",
222433,,This is our home.
222434,,"We will fight beside you, but you do not give the orders here, dragons."
222435,So be it.,
222436,Fine.,
222487,GY's test record! TimeKellyEvent is cool!,
222685,,A storm...
222850,,"Ah, Nozdormu. I am pleased that not all the Aspects have met a bitter end. Not yet."
222851,,Tell your queen I am coming for her. The storm's reckoning comes for you all!
222852,The release of Raszageth heralds great danger for this world. Just as your awakening heralds great change.,
222853,"The kingdoms of Azeroth must be warned. Go to them. Along the way, you may discover a new destiny of your own.",
222915,The Primalists are attacking! Get our defenses back up and running.,
222949,"The Azure Archives have a vast collection of magical items. I won't have much control over this, but surely something useful will come out!",
222950,"Nope, not that. Definitely not that.",
222951,Ugh... I'm losing connection! Come on!,
222952,Phew. I think this will do!,
222982,Oh my!,
223037,"I need to fend off the Primalists to the east. It may fall on you to aid Kalecgos, adventurer.",
223039,Fine work. Hold though... more Primalists are coming!,
223040,Champion!,
223048,Fall back! We'll set up defensive positions--,
223050,The Kirin Tor shall not fall to these monsters!,
223067,I must return to the archives. Send help when you can... the Azure Oathstone is proving difficult to reclaim.,
223206,Those shamans are tough! Use a charge or a blast to take them out!,
223222,,Just the reinforcements I needed!
223223,Show no mercy to these aberrations!,
223224,Can you bring down this barrier?,
223540,Raszageth!,
223790,,I am glad your daughter could hold onto her father's last gift. No magical research is worth that.

223792,Guess who has a nice haul of fish from the gleamlet!,
223793,,DAD! You've been gone forever!
223794,It's only been a few hours! And guess what... Ruriq made you another toy boat!,
223795,,This one is WAY cooler than my old boat!
223796,,Toolk will be the most spoiled girl in all Iskaara if you keep this up!

224044,Wrathion! You were warned against making unannounced visits. Especially when you bring company.,
224045,"A thousand pardons, my dear spymaster, but I come bearing the tidings of the Dragon Aspects for Lord Commander Turalyon.",
224046,"As for the dracthyr, you have my word that they will cause no harm. They have come seeking refuge, not conflict.",
224047,"Their conduct will be on your head, Wrathion. The dracthyr have my leave to roam the city. But know this... SI:7 will be watching.",
224048,Let them pass!,
224049,,"Stand down, warriors of the Horde!"
224050,,"Spiritwalker Ebonhorn! It is good to meet a familiar face at the city gate, even when accompanied by others that are... less familiar."
224051,"I am glad to find you well, Mayla. But I fear pleasantries will have to wait.",
224052,Events are unfolding that imperil us all. These dracthyr and I must speak with the Horde Council.,
224053,,"Then let us not linger. Follow me. Soldiers, return to your posts."
224054,,"If these newcomers have earned your trust, Spiritwalker, then they will have mine as well. The gates of Orgrimmar stand open to them."

224671,,The dracthyr will defend it.

225611,We've been scattered for far too long. Isolated.,
225612,But a dragonflight is more than an oath we make--we are a family.,

226575,"We have much to learn from you, Eraleshk. It is fortuitous that you are here to join our studies.",
226578,,It's very likely! We haven't found a recording like that in some time. This will take our research in a whole new direction!
226747,No one takes to the sky like a Wildhammer. HERE COMES THE THUNDER!,
226748,For Aerie Peak!,
226749,What a race! I could get used to this dragonridin'.,
226750,"I'd have beaten ye if I had my Sharpbeak with me. No offense, Scratchy.",
227050,,"At long last, our absent young are once more among us so that they can be raised together with all the flights."
227052,,"Though these Life Pools were once bereft of eggs, they now contain our future."
227053,,"Truly, the calling of my flight has been fulfilled."
227055,,I will see that these eggs are protected and loved.
227056,,"So that they may hatch into dragons, strong and wise."
227080,The Maruuk centaur include many individual clans across the plains.,
227081,"There are four of us who hold the most power: Clans Teerai, Shikaar, Nokhud, and Ohn'ir.",
227082,"Clan Teerai are the keepers of our traditions. Their leader, the Khanam Matra, is the cultural khan of all Maruuk. All khanam matras can trace their bloodlines back to our first matriarch, Teera.",
227083,"We of Clan Shikaar are the strongest hunters. You can find our camps spread throughout the plains, following the patterns of wildlife and game.",
227084,,"Clan Nokhud has recently come to power. A generation ago, Jhakan Khan led his people to defeat Clan Toghus, taking their place of power amongst the plains."
227085,,"His son, Balakar Khan, now leads this clan. His father was a man of honor, but Balakar Khan did not inherit his father's patience or wisdom."
227086,,"My clan, Clan Ohn'ir, is made up of those who feel a direct connection to our god, Ohn'ahra. She guided our founders, Maruuk and Teera, to the Dragon Isles, and she has watched over our people ever since."
227087,,"The mystics of Clan Ohn'ir are initiated from many different clans, but we all followed Ohn'ahra's call to serve her and our people."
227088,"The clans have their differences, but we share one culture. No matter our strengths and weaknesses, we are all Maruuk.",
227396,Sabellian? What is he doing?,
227459,,Okay everyone!
227460,,Get ready!
227461,,<Roars in pain.>
227462,,Oh no you don't!
227463,My vision came too late.,
227464,They have punched a tunnel through time and are tumbling endlessly amongst the infinite possibilities.,
227465,You must find them and correct their course before the entire fabric of reality is torn asunder.,
227467,"We secured the Azure Archives, but Raszageth's storm remains enveloped around Vakthros Tower.",
227468,,"She seeks to free her kin, but their prison does not lie within the Azure Span."
227469,,What else could she be after?
227470,My vision... remains clouded.,
227471,"The Primalists could already be moving in our midst, and I fear I would not see it.",
227472,The city must be protected.,
227473,Valdrakken is our people's home.,
227474,,"If the Primalists are here, we must find them and flush them out."
227475,,They cannot be allowed to infiltrate our seat of power.
227477,"Your guards did not join our ranks as expected, Eranog.",
227478,I am not concerned. Dead soldiers cannot get in your way.,
227482,I see you have unearthed the flame stone.,
227485,I can sense its strength.,
227494,It is now time for your end of this bargain.,
227497,<shouts loudly in pain>,
227501,Arise.,
227503,Primalist Eranog.,
227504,I pledge this power to free my kind from the leash of the Aspects.,
227505,"Then go, while I turn this wretched titan-stained place into ashes.",
227639,,We're almost done!
227640,,We'll be back soon!
227641,,Brace yourselves.
227642,,Whew! Our Oathstone... it's restored!
227643,,I never want to go so far into the past again!
227644,,But I'm glad I had some help getting back!
227645,You have aided Chronormu.,
227646,"For that, I am grateful and will spare you.",
227647,But leave.,
227648,Quickly.,
227649,,We will bring you to your ultimate fate.
227650,,You cannot deny what is to come.
227651,,"When we meet again, do not expect clemency for what has transpired."
227653,,Ummm... Where are we?
227654,,Is this even Azeroth?
227655,It is Azeroth.,
227656,"Though, an exceptionally long time ago.",
227657,,We should find Chromie and get out of here.
227658,,This place is scary.
227858,Primalists!,
227859,Noriko! Call for Kalecgos.,
227880,"Let the storm envelop you, windsage.",
227973,Mother!,
228402,,"With the oathstones of each flight renewed,"
228403,,"This sacred artifact, and symbol of the unity of dragonkind, lies within Tyrhold."
228404,,"Koranos, what can you tell us of it?"
228405,,It has been many centuries since we last walked the halls of Tyr's stronghold.
228406,"When the Isles awakened, so too, did the guardians of Tyrhold.",
228407,"While some have resumed their duties, others have taken to acting... erratically.",
228408,"Should you go there, I cannot guarantee the greeting you will receive.",
228409,,I understand.
228410,,"However, I have faith that with the help of our champion, we can overcome any danger."
228411,,What has happened to this egg?
228412,,The energies that surround it are...
228413,,This is dire.
228414,,"If the egg can be saved, it will be here, within the sacred waters of the Life Pools."
228415,,Once the young of dragonkind filled this vibrant place.
228416,,"And the Ruby Oathstone, the very symbol of our calling, cast its bright glow high into the air for all to see."
228417,,"Now it lies dormant, as do all the oathstones."
228418,,I suspect they fell quiet when we relinquished our aspectral power.
228419,,There are so many things we left behind.
228420,,"But now that we have come home, we can fulfill the callings of our flights and renew the five oathstones."
228422,,"And through their unity, our absent power shall be restored."
228426,,"I, the Khanam Matra Sarest, accept this gift to honor the ancient oath made by our most sacred ancestor."
228427,,All centaur under Ohn'ahra's wings will aid the green dragonflight in times of need.
228428,,"And I, Merithra, daughter of Ysera, accept this gift to honor my oath to your ancestor Teera."
228429,,"Together, dragons and centaur will protect the Ohn'ahran Plains."
228430,,The bond that united us in ages past has been renewed.
228431,,"Should the Dream be threatened again, know that the Maruuk will fight beside you."
228432,,Let this oathstone serve as a symbol of our covenant.
228433,,"I vow to protect the Emerald Dream, and the green dragonflight, with my life."
228436,"Behold, Stormwind!",
228437,Capital of the human kingdom and crown jewel of the Alliance.,
228438,"Ruled by a dear, dear friend who is...",
228439,...sadly absent.,
228440,Impressive walls.,
228441,This city could withstand attack by a formidable adversary.,
228442,Perhaps even a dragon.,
228443,You have no idea.,
228444,"Now then, to make a proper entrance, pardon me while I assume a more recognizable form.",
228445,"Ah, yes. The Earth-Warder too had a visage.",
228446,So these... humans know you?,
228447,Indeed! I have no doubt they will welcome me with open...,
228448,...arms.,
228464,Orgrimmar.,
228465,Within these walls gather the noble races of the Horde.,
228466,A city built upon a foundation of strength and honor.,
228467,,Traits my people embody as well.
228468,,Impressive structure.
228469,,But nothing that would hold back the might of the Dark Talons.
228470,I have no doubt your soldiers will be given many chances to prove themselves.,
228471,"Before we enter, I will assume another form.",
228472,One that is more recognizable to the Horde.,
228474,,"A visage. Yes, I remember the Earth-Warder had one too."
228475,,"Well, we have arrived. Where are your allies, Ebyssian?"
228476,"Patience, Cindrethresh.",
228477,I am sure we will receive an appropriate...,
228478,...welcome.,
228562,,"Walk with us, $n. We have many stories to share."
228563,,"Two-foot, you've fought many foes in your time, yes? You will have to share some stories."
228571,,"Have I ever shared the tale of my first kill, Belika? A mighty hornstrider with horns as tall as its legs were long! I keep its horn as a trophy."
228572,"It was a good kill, Tomul. My first was a mighty bear of ice and snow, deep in the frozen tundra of the Azure Span. My bakar and I knew no equals. We were the talk of the Khural!",
228573,,"Ah, we have reached our first stop. Circle the wagons, Shikaar. It is time for a hunt."
228575,"The Horn of Drusahl will be visible once we cross the bridge. You must see it, two-foot!",
228576,"Ah, yes. The Horn represents the ancient pact formed by Teera and a green dragon named Merithra. Their friendship ended a long enmity between dragons and Maruuk.",
228577,"Afterward, the centaur hunted the plains, and the dragons tended the gardens. But they agreed to help one another in times of need. The Horn of Drusahl was built as a physical manifestation of their oath.",
228578,,"But then, the dragons left. And after ten thousand years, they return to these lands! I am interested to hear what the Khanam Matra says about that."
228579,,"We are guided by Ohn'ahra, Tomul. It was she who granted us these lands, who arbitrated with the dragons. She knows the way."
228580,,"Ohn'ahra, the Windmother, is the ancestor of all ohuna. She led our founders, Maruuk and Teera, to the plains. My clanmates interpret her songs to advise our people."
228581,,Hold! I hear her call. Ohn'ahra will sing to me here.
228582,Maruukai is just ahead. It is a grand and sacred meeting place. Centaur from all around the plains gather there.,
228583,"Each season we meet for the Khural, a time of truce and communion. Clans large and small come together, sharing our resources and our stories.",
228584,,I do look forward to reconnecting to my peers. Perhaps Tigari Khan can help me decipher this omen from the river.
228585,,I am going to avoid the Nokhud. They antagonize everyone at these things.
228586,The rest of the Shikaar should have already arrived from the other camps. Our rise should be well settled by the time we arrive.,
228587,"It seems the other clans beat us here. Between our outsider and the green dragon emissary, this should be a Khural to remember.",
228712,,"Dark Talons, fall in!"
228713,,"Lead the way, Ebyssian."
228715,,The Warders will follow Wrathion.
228725,,Thank goodness.
228726,,Mother...
228728,,[DNT] <Mirthful sigh.>
228736,,We have to leave the Reach.
228758,,Now!
228759,,Let the winds carry us onward! The Emerald Gardens will fall!
228936,"Ah, young Wrathion. I owe you my thanks--",
228937,Your help was invaluable in securing my rightful place on the Obsidian Throne.,
228938,"Oh... I believe you are mistaken--this throne, this legacy--is my birthright.",
228939,No. The mistake is yours. I was anointed caretaker of this flight by Neltharion himself.,
228940,"So let me be clear... when all is said and done, I will be the Aspect of the black dragonflight.",
228943,Is that so? May the worthiest dragon win.,
229009,,Halt!
229010,Get away from... do not...,
229011,,Is this what passes for a mystic of the Maruuk?
229012,,"Ysera, your flight needs you."
229013,,We need you.
229014,,"Whatever the price may be for your return to Azeroth, name it."
229015,Tyrande...,
229016,Ohn'ahra... I am sorry.,
229017,,Tell us!
229018,It's me.,
229019,I must be the one to stay.,
229020,,What?
229021,Ysera knows this--though she would never ask it of me.,
229022,,No.
229023,,Pathetic.
229024,,We will find another way.
229025,"When she gave her life for mine in Val'sharah, it was not her time.",
229026,And now... the balance may be restored.,
229027,,Then... then I will stay as well.
229028,,Shandris and the others can...
229029,Tyrande...,
229030,"Should everything we hope come to pass, the Kaldorei will need you.",
229031,,"I am so tired, Malfurion."
229032,,Do not ask this of me.
229033,,After everything we have endured...
229034,My love.,
229035,You have always been the strength of our people.,
229037,"They will follow you ever onward, and you will never be alone.",
229038,,Until I see you again...
229039,,I will dream of the night we may truly rest... together.
229042,,How is this possible...
229043,,"The Maruuk, too, have been plagued by these Primalists."
229046,,"If Ohn'ahra wills it, I will blow the Horn of Drusahl on the morrow to signal our accord with the green dragonflight."
229047,,"Merithra, daughter of Ysera, is grateful for your..."
229054,Grateful? Ha! Dragons only respect dragons.,
229057,No Maruuk blood will be spilled for them.,
229059,,"You are not the Khanam Matra, Balakar."
229061,A true leader would never surrender this land to outsiders.,
229062,"You desecrate the memory of Maruuk Thousandbones, Sarest.",
229063,,Stand down!
229065,No. These plains belong to the Maruuk.,
229066,And Maruukai belongs to the Nokhud!,
229176,We'll hold them off as best as we can until he arrives. Hurry!,
229178,I... hope that worked. I need my flight.,
229181,,We will see in due time.
229184,Khadgar--what's happened?,
229185,The Primalists are on the move!,
229186,It seems we did far too well at stymieing their efforts at Vakthros.,
229187,Raszageth has renewed the attack herself!,
229188,,"If Vakthros falls, the whole of the Azure Span will fall with it."
229189,"Quickly then! We must stop her, before all is lost!",
229190,Hopefully we won't have to face her alone.,
229192,,Weakling... you need a mortal to defend you!
229193,,"Abominations, both of you... and you will perish here, cold and alone!"
229194,He is not alone!,
229195,,"You have failed, ""Aspect"". You will soon learn that killing you would have been a mercy."
229196,,Now you can watch your empire collapse alongside your false queen.
229278,Hmm...,
229358,,Let us face this enemy together.
229446,,"Majordomo, protect the eggs below while I distract Raszageth. She will not harm our young!"
230216,,[DNT][TEST] TimeKellyEvent 10.0!
230377,,"Destroy the artifact? No! Don't you see? Now that I know where it is, we can use its power to end all the enemies of the Kirin Tor!"
230378,,The power will consume you like it consumed the others! It must be destroyed.
230379,,No. You will thank me upon my return. I will bring peace to the Azure Span!
230381,To'tik... $n... what do we do?,
230383,,We destroy the artifact.
230554,Thank you... now we are free.,Thank you... now we are free.
230563,,Please... warn others of my tale. Ensure no one else makes my mistake.

230877,,Work quickly.
230880,,The convoy yielded enough eggs to begin.
230881,,Wash away the stain of Order.
230882,,Outsiders have come ashore.

242622,I'd like to see the Sapphire Enclave!,
242623,Let's visit the Obsidian Enclave!,
242624,Let's visit the Emerald Enclave!,
242625,Next let's see the Artisan's Market!,
242626,Let's see my friends at the Little Scales Daycare!,
242627,Let's go see the Seat of the Aspects!,
242628,I want to visit Cascade's Edge!,
242629,I'd like to visit the Aqueduct Basin!,
242633,,Thank you champion.
242634,,"Without you and Chronormu's bravery,"
242635,,Nozdormu?
242636,,Everything's back how it was.
242637,Not everything.,
242638,"The clouds in my vision have parted,",
242639,I feel... alive again. Thanks to you.,
242641,,But what of Iridikron?
242642,,"While we stopped the infinites,"
242643,,A voidgate...
242644,,It feels like he's leaving this war to his kin.
242645,,His hatred for the titans is all he cares about.
242646,,"Nozdormu, can you perceive where he has gone?"
242647,He has passed beyond my sight.,
242648,All I see now... are burning embers...,
242649,,Merithra must be warned.
242650,,"If Fyrakk leads their forces now, he will be vicious"
242651,,The World Tree...
242652,,"Yes. As dangerous as he is,"
242653,,for now we must leave Iridikron to his schemes
242655,,The defense of Amirdrassil comes first.
242656,"No matter what lies ahead,",
242657,The future is worth fighting for.,
242658,,I knew you would come.
242665,,"After you forced us into slumber in that Titan prison,"
242667,,You heard me...
242668,,Every word. You said...
242669,,"""It doesn't feel like a victory... not without you."""
242670,,How could you say that? After everything--
242671,,You were my dearest friend!
242673,,You promised me you would not force the Titans' will upon us.
242674,,"But the eggs, Alexstrasza."
242675,,You did nothing while your masters warped our children still in the shell!
242676,,That abhorrent act should never have happened
242677,,Your lies have grown sweeter.
242678,,Honey to hear
242679,,Vyranoth... you have always fought for the good of dragonkind.
242681,,Vengeance is all he craves.
242683,,"Still so naive, Alexstrasza."
242684,,Believing that the world we once shared still exists.
242685,,It is gone.
242686,,"And so, yes. All that remains..."
242687,,is vengeance.
242724,Alright! Let's start!,
242725,Wow!,
242726,This is neat!,
242727,Look at that!,
242728,Hi everyone!,
242730,Look at the aspects!,
242823,"That enough, please take me back.",
242824,I'd like to go back now.,
242825,Please drop me off.,
242851,,"Oh, there you are! Here to see Nozdormu, right?"
242852,,"Lucky for you, I'm here to help solve everything! As usual."
242947,,I could not imagine what would have--
242948,,Nozdormu!
242952,"and I can breathe without doubt, or despair.",
242953,,<sighs with relief>
242954,,Iridikron escaped through a kind of void tear...
242955,,taking Galakrond's essence with him.
242956,,his dark dealings have come to fruition.
242957,encroaching upon...,
242958,<winces>,
242959,,and strike where we are most vulnerable.
242960,"you were right, Chronormu.",
242961,,and steel ourselves for whatever Fyrakk and Vyranoth are preparing to unleash.
242966,,you came to me.
242968,,And losing you to this conflict broke my heart.
242970,,and poison to taste.
242971,,and I regret my part in it every day.
242972,,But Iridikron does not.
243110,,<Sighs>
243865,You're certain it was him?,
243866,My agents in Ratchet confirmed it. He was seen buying supplies.,
243867,Why Kalimdor? Why wouldn't he return home to Stormwind?,
243868,I don't know. But he was traveling south.,
243870,Must have noticed my people on his tail. He lost them in the Barrens.,
243874,South... What could he be after?,
243875,Send word to Jaina. She'll want to know where he's headed.,
243876,You don't want to go after him yourself?,
243877,"If he's staying away, he must have his reasons. We need to trust him.",
243878,Should I inform Lord Commander Turalyon?,
243879,"No. Not until we know more. Let's keep this quiet, Spymaster.",
243880,"It will be done, King Greymane.",
244415,"Greetings, honorable Djaradin.",
244417,Tuskarr. What do you bring to trade?,Tuskarr. What do you bring to trade?
244419,"Oh, only a selection of the finest fish caught in our very rivers!",
244420,"And in return, the harpoons which have proven so effective against the dragons above.",
244421,...These fish will not be enough.,...These fish will not be enough.
244422,"How perceptive! These are just a sample. We guarantee enough fish to make your belly as full as mine, if you wish.",
244730,,"Let the waters cleanse your spirit, as we have cleansed the well."
244753,,"Lotus petals bloom, granting color to your mark--just as your purpose blooms within you."
244958,,My sister. I am sorry.
244959,,The child. Keep them safe.
244961,,Child?
244962,Things are not always what they seem.,
244963,"Come out, little one. You are safe now.",
244965,,A newborn whelp!
244966,Born during the confrontation with Vexemia.,
244967,,Vexemia would have killed the whelp and destroyed the eggs.
244968,For our future.,
244969,She's gone now.,
244970,You will make it.,
244971,,I... Let us leave this place.
244998,,Stop! We have come only to help our friend!
245002,,Marithos the traitor? Then you will share his fate!
245004,"Stand down! They are your allies, not traitors!",
245009,,Winglord Dezran! You have returned to lead us--to carry on Sarkareth's legacy!
245010,No. That path led us to ruin.,
245011,I relinquish my command to Scalecommander Emberthal.,
245015,,"We can unite our people, Dezran."
245016,I cannot. My crimes demand exile.,
245019,,I bet this will be the last time Nirobin drinks my tea without asking.
245020,,Winglord! Please... Stay with us!
245021,"With all due respect, sir. These soldiers need you.",
245035,Very well.,
245162,Talthis...,
245163,I am proud to stand with you this day.,
245164,And proud that you have come to embody the spirit of Tyr's legacy:,
245165,"order, sacrifice, justice, and compassion.",
245166,May the Light bless our mission... For Tyr!,
245239,Enough!,
245240,,<grunts>
245241,,Lysander! Now!

245243,,<grunts>
245244,<dying cry>,
245245,"Everyone, to the portal!",
245246,,"Lysander, are you--"
245247,Look... the moonwell!,
245248,,It is done.
245249,,When Tyrande decreed that arcane practitioners would return to our numbers...
245250,,I vehemently protested.
245251,"You had every right to be wary, warden.",
245252,,Yet today I have witnessed who you truly are...
245253,,"A strong, resilient defender of the kaldorei."
245254,,Should you wish it--your face will bear the mark of protector.
245255,I thought... men were not permitted such...,
245256,,"Even sacred traditions should evolve, as should the kaldorei."
245257,,Go on!
245275,"Finally, a moment to rest...",
245276,"The Earth Warder commands you to die, dracthyr!",
245282,,"Amirdrassil is here and balance takes wing once more. Much of this is due to your tenacity and courage. Thank you for your aid, my friend."
245283,Accept the flame into your heart and grow.,
245284,,My heart burns with renewal.
245285,,Look out!
245286,,Behold the weapons of shadowflame... and your end.
245287,,"Follow me! Take the portal, now!"
245288,,"Fly, little dragon. My greatest creation will cleave your wings."
245297,Noooo!,
245298,Invincible... I'm sorry...,
245510,Quickly!,
245857,Behold sister!,
245858,The burning might of our new allies.,
245859,,What have you done to this creature?
245861,Imbued it with the living flame.,
245862,The very flame we will infuse into the heart,
245863,of their precious world tree.,
245864,,"Iridikron entrusted us to deny the Aspects their prize,"
245865,,not twist it into some vile abomination.
245866,Iridikron isn't here anymore.,
245867,"Besides, he is the one who set me free.",
245868,Who begged me to drink deep of the shadowflame.,
245869,He knew what was necessary to win this war.,
245870,,We took up arms together to free the world from the titans' meddling.
245871,,That is the war I fight.
245872,,That is the victory I seek.
245873,(growls),
245874,We cannot achieve victory,
245875,with our hands bound by your ideals!,
245876,,Then our course is set.
245910,,A needle of briarthorn to bear the ink to skin--just as you bear the charge you carry.
245911,,"Bruiseweed, to numb the pain--"
245912,--I do not need it.,
245913,,The world gifts us with means to move beyond this pain. You prove nothing by choosing to dwell in it.
245914,"I... understand, Warden.",
245915,,Maiev.
245916,,Mother and father would be proud... as am I.
245920,,I will speak with your Dragon Queen!
245921,,Then speak.
245922,,No doubt you are aware of what my brother is after.
245923,,Every gateway to the Emerald Dream has been secured
245924,,and is well-defended.
245925,,It is not a gate he seeks.
245926,,"With the Druids of the Flame at his side,"
245927,,Fyrrak will tear his way into that realm
245928,,and march his forces upon the World Tree.
245929,,His forces?
245930,,They will fail.
245931,,This World Tree will not be burned.
245932,,Burn it?
245933,,He comes to claim it.
245934,,To twist its pure heart into a mirror of what his own has become --
245935,,"It is done. Rise, Lysander."
245936,,"cruel, blazing with insatiable malice,"
245937,,and wreathed in shadow.
245938,,I cannot stand with him.
245939,,He is my brother no more.
245940,,Vyranoth ...
245941,,Do what you will with this knowledge.
245943,,"Farewell, Alexstrasza."
245944,,Stand with us.
245945,,(astonished sigh)
245946,,Why would I do that?
245947,,"Because you are a protector of this world,"
245948,,and you do not want to see it burn.
245949,,(scoffs)
245950,,"Please, hear me now."
245951,,I failed you before.
245952,,I failed our people.
245953,,Yes. You did.
245954,,I will not fail them again.
245955,,"Stand with us, Vyranoth."
245956,,For all dragonkind.
245957,"Thank you, Nari.",
245971,,Indeed.
245974,,"Come, Lysander."
246043,"I can hardly believe my eyes. Fyrakk's legendary axe! Fyr'alath, Dreamrender!",
246044,My ingenious plan will unlock its true potential. I can't wait to see it realized!,
246045,Are you insane? Fyrakk nearly burned down the Dreaming with that abominable weapon!,
246046,"No one should wield it. Ever! No one can tame it! Anything its shadowflame cannot corrupt, it destroys.",
246047,,"Wrathion, if anyone is capable of ""taming"" this axe, it's $p, our friend and ally."
246048,,Perhaps there's a way to... cleanse... the weapon's corruption.
246049,"Oh, I find that proposition quite dubious! This weapon cannot be purified... but I suspect its shadowflame can be... contained. Allow me to reiterate my theory...",
246050,"If we wrapped its haft in enchanted cloth... with an efficacious application of the right rituals... and then secured the assistance of an enchanter, a leatherworker, and a master of inscription...",
246051,"I owe you a debt of gratitude, $p, so I won't stand in your way. But I insist on watching your progress.",
246052,,So be it. Let's put Eadweard's theory to the test.
246183,"I... am aware of how this appears, Prophet. I will try to be brief.",
246184,I believed Kil'jaeden and Archimonde. Their promises of prosperity for our people. How could I not?,
246185,"And so when they demanded we pay the Legion's price, I trusted them. We all did.",
246186,"Doubt was betrayal in his eyes. And betrayal, as you know, meant death.",
246187,And I feared death more than the price of my sin.,
246188,"In the end, some of us fled the Legion. But the damage was already done.",
246189,"What will you do now, Arzal'kal?",
246190,"I want to show that I am no longer a coward. I cannot undo my crimes, but I will give all I have to try.",
246459,Moraidormi knew if she did not distract her--,
246460,,She died.
246461,,My sister chose to die--
246462,Get help.,
246463,Go on.,
246483,<soft groan>,
246490,"It cannot be... and yet I behold it. A shard of the Ata'mal crystal. Brilliant Star, it was called.",
246491,"This shard was lost to me on Draenor, taken by the orcs. I had thought it gone forever.",
246492,"Nearly. When the orcs disposed of it after their corruption, Kil'jaeden reclaimed it for the Legion.",
246493,Many seized it since the Deceiver's death. But I could not let it remain in their bloodied hands.,
246494,I was willing to die for it. I sought out the krokul. And then I sought out you.,
246495,There are no words to express my gratitude.,
246496,I do not deserve your gratitude. I should have done this sooner.,
246497,I understand. I also have been forced to make difficult choices. At Eredath and Shattrath.,
246498,But forgiveness is not easily given. Too many have suffered.,
246501,I do not expect forgiveness. I cannot be forgiven. Not in a thousand lifetimes.,
246502,"But if this twisted soul can still do any good, I will see it done.",
246504,"Others have proven stronger than their darkness. The orcs, death knights, and Illidari. Perhaps there is a path forward.",
246505,"There is much I would like to discuss with you, Arzal'kal, and others who believe as you do.",
246506,"Please, just... Arzaal. If I may return, I would have it be with the name I had when I left.",
246507,"Very well. Come, Arzaal.",
246508,I... did not expect Velen to react this way. He did not have to.,
246509,Perhaps things are different now. Perhaps we both are. I will... allow myself to hope.,
246812,%s nods.,
246865,You can make it.,
246886,<frustrated growl>,
246894,,I would be honored if you served as my Winglord.
246896,"Reporting for duty, Scalecommander Emberthal.",
246897,Nolaki...,
246899,Hadwin...,
246900,Valunei...,
246901,Come forward.,
246902,"As Captain of the Tyr's Guard,",
246903,I welcome you to our ranks.,
246999,We must bridge the divide between us.,
247000,The Sundered Flame must become the Ebon Scales once more.,
247141,For Tyr!,
247169,"Excellent, $n. Give it some time and if this plant is what I think it is, you'll bring some happiness back to this empty glade.",
247216,,Wow!
247217,Did it work?,
247218,Alexstrasza...,
247219,,"Welcome back, old friend."
247230,Valunei! What are you doing?,
247231,,"Elisande, please! We need that disc to restore the memories of our friend, Keeper Tyr."
247232,,His mind holds many secrets that could aid my cause.
247234,,I know you want what's best for your people.
247235,,So be it.
247243,Cowardly beasts!,
247244,"Stand down, Galok.",
247245,Not while I yet live!,
247254,,We will suffer your evil no longer!
247258,The djaradin will be your doom!,
247262,Enough of this foolishness!,
247265,,I agree.

247283,,<screams>
247284,,I trust the weapons I supplied you were effective.
247285,,Good.
247286,,But bring me any prisoners you capture.
247287,,"Fyrakk may want them for more... ""testing."""
247288,It will be done!,
247381,"Very well. Show me, if it will ease your pain.",
247413,,Dragons of the storm!
247414,,"You are true dragons, not constructs beholden to an unworthy keeper!"
247415,,You are free to choose your own path.
247416,,"If you wish it, there is a home for you on the Dragon Isles."
247417,,Join your kin and claim your birthright!
247443,We waste precious time.,
247444,Is this simple task too much for you?,
247445,Once the Wellspring is filled with flames... my flames... it will set the entire realm ablaze.,
247446,"Then through that tree, all Azeroth will burn.",
247447,Yet you would have me squander my power to make up for your failures?,
247448,I only thought...,
247449,Forgive me. We will bring this barrier down.,
247450,No. You will not.,
247471,Behold!,
247472,I bless you with the embers of Ragnaros.,
247473,Protect your brethren. Protect Fyrakk.,
247474,You all have seen the destruction caused by Tyrande!,
247475,,She refused to join us in the restoration of our people's immortality!
247476,,These lies poison my people against me.
247477,"She would bring a tree of death into the world, condemning the kaldorei to the Shadowlands!",
247478,We must ensure Fyrakk makes way for the new Firelord.,
247479,,Traitors! Apostates! This madness ends here!
247504,,Behold. Amirdrassil.

247506,,"Until the tree crosses over into our world, we must defend this symbol of hope from--"
247507,,No! We must save them!
247558,,The Bloom begins.
247559,,It is weakening the barrier.

247582,,Defenders of the Dream!

248471,,Of course.

248507,I did. Kil'jaeden had a way of invading the mind. Any doubt would be known to him immediately.,

248812,And yet still you paid it.,

249079,,Something... unexpected.
249080,How can this be?,
249081,Our aspectral powers... have returned?,

249087,,this time...

249089,I felt her presence. It was... beautiful.,
249090,,"Ah, now I understand."
249091,,"I thought, to survive,"
249092,,we needed to reclaim our aspectral powers.
249093,,But they were never ours to take.

249095,,And so we did.

249099,,"But in uniting for a cause greater than ourselves,"

250805,,My dear friends. So much has happened since we awoke in our creches.

250808,"After everything you endured, Emberthal, are you...",
250809,,I am at peace.

250811,,And what about each of you?
250814,,"At first, I was skeptical whether we dracthyr would be a good fit for the Horde. But I have grown fond of them... and they of us."
250816,,My favorites are the vulpera. Feisty little squirrels... or whatever they are.
250817,"Likewise, the Alliance has formally offered us a place in its ranks. Its members are brave and noble, worthy of our allegiance.",
250818,I believe Lord Commander Turalyon has come to admire our discipline. He appreciates skilled soldiers.,
250819,,"When we emerged into this new age, we did not know who we could trust."
250820,,Now we have many allies. Both in the mortal kingdoms and among the dragons.
250822,,Including a new Earth-Warder who won't lock us away for millennia! Probably.

250826,,Now what fun would that be?
250827,,"Come, friends. There is so much that awaits us... in the Dragon Isles, and beyond."

251114,,When we dragons returned to our homeland...
251115,,Old wounds and bitter memories had fractured our unity.
251116,,But thanks to you and all those who stood with us...
251117,,We realized that the mistakes of our past need not define us.
251118,,That we should not fear the unknown.
251119,,That we could embrace our family...
251120,,While building a new legacy for our flights.
251121,,A legacy that includes all dragonkind.
251122,,In recognition of everything you have done...
251132,,Such beauty. Such tranquility.
251133,,More kaldorei settle here every day.
251134,,This village welcomes all who wish to dwell here.
251135,,"Hyjal, Val'sharah, Ashenvale..."
251136,,"And one day, when life blossoms again upon its ashen shores..."

251138,,"Mother, do you sense..."
251141,,"Yes, my child. I would know his presence anywhere."
251143,,"Father, we have so much to tell you..."
251144,"As I slumbered within Ardenweald, Ysera let me dream through her eyes. I saw the courage you showed defending Amirdrassil.",
251145,I am so proud of you both. And of all the heroes of Azeroth who joined together for this cause.,
251146,,"Though we will never forget the past, it is time to look forward."
251147,,Our people will be pleased to have both of you leading them into that future.
251148,,"No, my beloved daughter. I think we will tarry here in Bel'ameth a while."
251149,,I believe we have earned some time alone together.
251150,"That we have, my love.",
251151,,But our people need--
251152,,"They have all they need in you, child."
251153,"You have grown into a wise leader, Shandris. Within you beats the heart of the kaldorei people.",
251154,"Trust your instincts. And if you have need of us, you know where we will be.",
251157,,Thank you. For your faith in me. For... everything.
251158,,Now come. I want to show you a spot that would be perfect for our home.
251159,I do hope there is room for a garden...,
251865,"Impeccable timing, $p. Khadgar should be arriving shortly.",
251866,"My ears are burning, Kalec! To what do I owe the honor?",
251867,"Bittersweet news, I'm afraid. Khadgar, I...",
251888,...I have chosen to step down from the Council of Six.,
251889,My duties as Aspect must take precedence. I'm needed in Valdrakken far more than in Dalaran.,
251891,"Is that all? Forgive me, but that hardly comes as a surprise. I suspected as much when you asked to speak with me.",
251892,So you do not think ill of me for relinquishing my position?,
251893,"Perish the thought. Your family comes first, Kalec. I could never fault you for that.",
251894,Though... I do have a request to make of you.,
251895,"The artifact Iridikron took from the Forbidden Reach, the one he handed over to this mysterious ""Harbinger""...",
251896,Dalaran's libraries hold precious little information on it. Given Malygos's history with Neltharion...,
251906,You hope that I might have better luck scouring the Azure Archives.,
251907,"Consider it done, old friend. I will share all the information I can find.",
251909,"Thank you, Kalec. Strange, isn't it? The Kirin Tor and the Aspect of Magic working hand in hand.",
251911,"It's a new age. One we will face together. Us, the Council, and whoever replaces me.",
251913,Rest assured we will fill your vacant seat... but no one could ever replace you.,
251914,"Farewell for now, Kalecgos. Be it here, Dalaran, or Karazhan, I look forward to our next reunion.",
251915,Wrathion. Ebyssian mentioned that you will soon depart from the Isles.,
251916,"I didn't take you as one who engaged in gossip, Sabellian.",
251917,Hmph. Does he speak true?,
251918,"He does. Iridikron may be lying low, but he still poses a significant threat to Azeroth.",
251919,I will coordinate the Blacktalon's efforts to track him down. Even Iridikron can't evade them forever.,
251920,"Indeed. I must admit, your agents have impressed me far more than I expected.",
251921,"With rare exception, I never placed much stock in mortals beforehand. You have quite the way with their kind.",
251922,I suppose I do...,
251923,"My time in the Dragon Isles was a grand adventure, but not the homecoming I'd hoped for.",
251924,I've often felt that I share more in common with mortals than with dragons... and feared that I belong among neither.,
251925,"I thought that here, in the land of my ancestors, I'd find... something I was lacking.",
251926,"That by becoming an Aspect, I could prove who and what I truly am. If not to the world, then at least to myself.",
251927,But I see now that I never had anything to prove. My place is among both mortals and dragons.,
251928,"That is my strength, not my failing. It's who I am. Who I've always been.",
251929,"Well said. You walk a path I never could, Wrathion. Take pride in it.",
251930,And should that path lead you back to the Dragon Isles... I hope it does feel like a homecoming.,
251931,"Hah! We shall see. Thank you, Brother.",
252111,,For Gilneas!
252114,,...we were a kingdom divided.
252115,,...we have found our way...
252116,,...we proclaim you...
252540,W-what?!,
252717,Let's discuss maintaining your sanity. The Void will do everything it can to shatter your will.,
253396,,...to offer our thanks.
253397,,...to a better future.
253398,,...Champion of the Dragonflights.
253435,You see the Void as an enemy. It sees you the same way. For now.,
253436,Its very nature is hostile to order. Life. Sanity.,
253439,You must dive deep into its shadows. Accept its many truths.,
253440,You cannot reject it. You must accept it.,
253443,<Heavy sigh.>,
253446,,"You're thinking of Liam again, aren't you."
253447,<Chuckle.>,
253448,You always could see right through me.,
253449,,You never really healed after you lost him.
253450,,After you lost Gilneas.
253452,"Oh Tess, I--",
253453,,"I see you, Father."
253454,,Always hiding from your pain.
253455,,It's why you built that wall in the first place.
253456,,And why you took Anduin under your wing.
253457,,But I have always been here...
253458,,For you.
253459,,Even if you've never noticed.
253460,<Sigh.>,
253461,I know. And...,
253462,I'm sorry.,
253463,"The world is changing, Tess.",
253464,"And as much as I try, I find it hard to change with it.",
253465,"But you have proven yourself a thousand times over, my girl.",
253466,And this kingdom...,
253467,...now belongs to you.,
253468,,"Father, I... I..."
253469,You--have always been what makes Gilneas truly special to me.,
253470,And I should have told you that.,
253471,Every day.,
253472,,I wish I could take your pain away.
253473,"Only time will do that, my dear.",
253475,"But we have time, now.",
253476,Thanks to you.,
253478,,"After so many years of strife,"
253479,,Bel'ameth offers rest and comfort.
253480,,But it shall not be our only home.
253481,,These are sacred places to us.
253482,,We shall protect them forever more.
253483,,...we will return to Teldrassil and build anew.
253484,,<Gasp.>
253485,,<Gasp.>
253486,,<Gentle laugh.>
253487,,<Sigh of relief.>
253488,,<Heavy breathing.>
253561,Xal'atath has returned as the Harbinger. And now she has the power of the Dark Heart at her disposal.,
253562,,It's all connected to the Radiant Song. It has to be.
253563,Locus-Walker said the ethereals heard a similar song before K'aresh was destroyed.,
253566,,Then is... Azeroth herself the one in danger? Is she speaking to us?
253567,We need answers. We need her Speaker.,
253568,,"I will seek out Magni. But first, I must inform Thrall of what we learned here."
253569,,We must face this crisis together. Horde and Alliance both.
253718,"Beledar's Shadow! Quickly, get inside!",
253719,"Faerin! Thank the Flame. Kobyss are raiding Sina's Yearning. The army went ahead, but--",
253720,,Faerin nods to you and Anduin.
253721,,"We must not lose our foothold there. Faerin, outsiders, fall in line. Soldiers, march!"
253722,,You're only acceptable once you've proven yourself useful... that's Steelstrike for you. But kobyss are deadly foes-- we should help. Are you both with me?
254048,,Say no more. Our new allies and I will go to their aid. Seek shelter immediately!
254126,We're with you.,
254131,,"Soldiers, with me!"
254132,,Help! I need--
254134,Not... with the Light. But I know first aid.,
254135,"Thank you, $n. Please help as many others as you can find.",
254181,,"I'm more fighter than healer! Anduin, can you--"
254189,,That will do. We'll send the injured your way.
254198,,Aelric thinks the shadows will save him. He should see what true power looks like...
254251,Only then will every ounce of power be yours to command.,
254252,"Embrace this wisdom, and your mind will yet be your own.",
254313,"Did I hear that right, earlier? You're a... Lothar?",
254315,,You know the name?
254316,"Know it? I was named for Anduin Lothar, one of Stormwind's greatest heroes. He was close friends with my grandfather, King Llane Wrynn.",
254320,,"Wait, if your grandfather was king of this... Stormwind, then--"
254322,,"Anduin, my new friend... are you a king?"
254323,Not anymore.,
254324,"...So don't you start using formalities on me, either.",
254918,Lady Proudmoore! Over here! I found $n!,Lady Proudmoore! Over here! I found $n!
254919,I'll get these rocks off you. Just let me--Ahh!,
255190,Alleria reported her findings regarding the strange phenomenon you have all been investigating.,
255191,We now believe the Dark Heart is capable of drawing in magical power and converting it to shadow.,
255194,"Your orders have not changed, however. You will still be responding to unusual void activity.",
255195,,Will Lady Windrunner be leading further investigations?
255196,Ah. I'm afraid she's... indisposed with her own mission at the moment.,
255197,Telogrus needs her. She's supposed to guide us.,
255198,"Alleria will return to us in time. But for now, you may seek Locus-Walker for guidance.",
255199,We ren'dorei do not have an easy path. The whispers shall always tempt us. Threaten to consume us.,
255200,Entire worlds can be destroyed by the power of the Void.,
255201,But it also allows us to protect Azeroth in a way no other can. To defend our home against the dark.,
255265,,Mueh'zala is not finished with the Darkspear.
255266,We are finished with him!,
255368,So it is Xal'atath who has claimed the Dark Heart...,
255369,I understand now why she calls herself the Harbinger.,
255370,,I've had enough riddles for one day...
255371,The radiant visions you spoke of are the very same my people had...,
255372,...before our world was consumed by the Void Lord Dimensius.,
255373,,What?! You don't think...
255374,,Could Xal'atath be seeking that same fate for Azeroth?
255383,I fear that is precisely what she intends.,
255384,You... must find a way to stop her.,
255385,,"Me?  Look, she knew exactly how to hurt me."
255386,,I don't think I'm the one to...
255387,"Yes, she knew your greatest fear is endangering your family.",
255388,But you must let go of that fear.,
255389,Embrace who you truly are.,
255390,,I know who I am.
255391,Do you? You are unbalanced.,
255392,"You must master your unique nature, Alleria.",
255393,If you cannot... then Azeroth is already doomed.,
255432,"For many, this may be your first Tishamaat.",
255433,Our last was long ago.,
255434,Few among us remember it.,
255435,"But even here,",
255436,"in another place and another time,",
255437,its meaning remains the same:,
255438,we must let go of the past...,
255439,...to grasp our future.,
255440,"No longer must we live scattered, lamenting Argus.",
255441,We will build a city on the ashes of our exile.,
255442,We will finally be home.,
255505,,Curse them all! Where did they take him? Do you see Anduin?
255506,,They dragged him down! I lost track of him!
255507,,Ash! We can't let them reach Mereldar! Blast them apart!
255508,,Incoming! I'll show them the Sacred Flame's blaze!
255509,,We've beaten them back! Let's get Anduin!
255510,,"Hold on! We don't know what's down there! Reinforcements are on the way, we could wait--"
255511,,We'll lose his trail!
255512,,You're right. Let's make those monsters pay for everything they've done!
255602,,My people are no strangers to voices from below...
255603,,"but this ""Radiant Song"" is different."
255605,It's being heard all across Azeroth.,
255606,The Council doesn't know what to make of it.,
255607,,There must be someone who does.
255608,,I'll let you know what I find.
255611,Alleria!,
255612,"It's been too long, old friend.",
255613,,"Good to see you, Khadgar."
255614,,Doing well?
255615,As well as can be expected.,
255616,How's the family?,
255618,,I haven't...
255620,,<sighs>
255621,,...it's better if I keep my distance.
255622,"Ah, of course...",
255623,the Void.,
255624,That would be... erm...,
255625,<clears throat>,
255626,"Actually, your connection to the Void is why I asked you here.",
255627,"We still don't know what this ""Dark Heart"" relic is capable of...",
255628,But we do know it's in the hands of someone called...,
255629,"""the Harbinger.""",
255630,Who they are--and what they intend to do--,
255631,remains a mystery.,
255632,Which is why I need your help.,
255633,,To hunt down a dangerous foe we know nothing about?
255635,,"Honestly, I could use the distraction."
255636,"Same old Alleria, Void or no Void.",
255637,<sighs>,
255638,Uh...,
255639,I didn't mean to...,
255640,,"See you soon, Khadgar."
255641,,Dark Heart in hand.
255659,,"Oh no, don't you start using formalities on me! My family is noble, but it's been long since we've seen great fortune."

255726,<battle cry>,
255727,,<cries out>

255741,"Yes, of course. On a matter of great importance.",
255742,Well. Is it not always a matter of great importance with you?,
255743,"I suppose it is. But on this auspicious occasion, I was hoping we could reconcile. And return to a place of trust.",
255744,"Some wounds take time to heal, Prophet. Though... Argus is far from this place. And feels like another life.",
255745,We trusted one another once...,
255746,We were young... and foolish once as well.,
255747,We were indeed. If we knew then what we know now...,
255748,"Hatuun, you have always been the best of us. I have missed your wisdom.",
255749,Come. Serve with me again as you once did on our council. We need--I need--your guidance once more.,
255750,"Velen, I...",
255751,You do not have to answer me now. Enjoy the Tishamaat. But there will always be a seat open for you--if you want it.,
255752,Thank you. I will... I will think on it.,
256290,,"Infinites, to me! We cannot let this wound fester!"
257629,You speak the truth? Your artifact will repair the Awakening Machine?,
257632,,"It will perfect the Machine. Your struggle, your suffering will be at an end. All will awaken... because of you."
257633,Because of me...,
257636,,"[CUT, DO NOT RECORD] Is there a price you wouldn't pay?"
257638,,Your people will be restored. Reborn. Improved. And they will laud you as their savior.
257641,Yes... yes! All earthen will awaken!,
257826,,Dalaran will not be a fly in Xal'atath's web.
257947,Help! Help! It's the HORROR OF XESH!,
259592,Do you see that? Nothing! Decidedly odd for the City of Threads.,
259593,The freshly Ascended are usually flitting about the Umbral Bazaar. Where have they gone?,
259672,Gathering supplies? Marching out? I've heard nothing of this!,
259676,"Make no mistake, this is preparation for war--and none thought to inform me. This bodes ill indeed.",
259689,,"Smuggling is common enough in the city, but from the Maddening Deep? Unusual and concerning."
259690,,"I need to know where they're taking that bile, why, and for whom."
259788,"Alleria, be careful.",
259789,,We are well past that.
260030,,I can see how worried you are about Dagran.
260031,"I've got a lot to make up for. For a long time, I knew I needed to protect Azeroth.",
260032,I gave up a lot. I gave up too much. I should have spent more time protecting you and Dagran.,
260033,,"Dagran's been through a lot, too."
260034,I know. I want to be here for him as his Gran'da.,
260036,I wasn't responsible enough. That needs to change.,
260037,I've spent too many years listening to Azeroth's voice. I'm glad I can listen to yours now.,
260038,,"Aye, Father. We'll figure it out together."
260042,,"I'm sorry, what? The prisoners escaped because of a nerubian?"
260043,That's what they said--one of the big ones from the heart of Siegehold. I'm as flummoxed as you are.,
260044,,It doesn't make any sense. None of this does.
260045,Come again?,
260046,,"It's nothing, Regald. I've just... I keep telling everyone it's about hope, but the moment push comes to shove my anger grabs my blade."
260047,"This had nothing to do with you. They've attacked before, they'll attack again. That's how it's always gone.",
260048,,But is it how it needs to go in the future? We are the holders of hope... Is there hope in this darkness that even we haven't been able to see?
260049,I... can't answer that for you.,
260050,,Honestly? Neither can I. I've... I've got some thinking to do.
260126,,Now! Go for the kill!
260245,,Hold back these kobyss! Today they taste ashes!
260792,"You have shown your true form? Orweyna, this is forbidden!",
260793,,The Black Blood spreads deeper every day. We need their aid--
260794,We need nothing from them!,
260795,,Enough!
260796,,We both know our charge. They are of this world. And they too seek to defend it.
260797,,"On'hiea... she speaks with the song of the world. You know it, as do I."
260798,The others will hear of this.,
260799,,At least it will not be the first tradition we have broken.
260800,,Go. All of you. I will join you soon.
260916,"Few names hold higher esteem. You must be a lady, or a--",
260917,,To think I had relatives in the old world? Wonderful! I hope I can live up to such legends.
261221,<grunts>,
261768,,The City of Threads. The heart of Azj-Kahet. Bled dry and dying.
261771,,None who enter leave in one piece. Your friend is likely dead.
261772,,"But I know you will not accept that. So you follow your path, and I will follow mine."
261774,,You have survived so far. Keep doing so. I hope we meet again.
261807,,The darkness hungers. Let's give Xal'atath's forces a taste of their own shadows.
261902,Think I not see? What YOU do in MY mine?,
261903,Run round. Steal candle. Kill kobold. Bah! Am Candle King!,
261904,"Snuffed little friend. Next time, snuff you.",
261905,Snootsnout! Leave new friends e-le-men-tal present. And close door behind. We not entertain today.,
262040,[DNT] Kahet iz korvan.,[DNT] Kahet iz korvan.
262567,,...and apologies for the delay.
262573,"Lok'tar, everyone.",
263623,"She's melting me, I--!",
263753,,Well done! Now let's regroup ahead.
263838,Deviants!,
263918,Must.. get away!,
264954,Alleria. I heard you helped corner Zirix at the Meadery. Thank you.,
264955,,The nerubians took so much from us. I will not let them do the same to the earthen.
264956,They've been good allies... and gracious hosts.,
264957,,"A welcome surprise, given that they've been living in isolation for thousands of years."
264958,That may not be entirely the case.,
264959,"I asked about why they keep calling me ""Arathi""... and apparently an Arathi armada arrived on Khaz Algar a number of years ago.",
264960,They're said to have formed a settlement in the caverns beneath the island. It sounds impossible...,
264962,"But if it's true, I want to see it for myself. They could prove to be allies in our fight against Xal'atath.",
264963,,No. We've secured a measure of safety here. Don't abandon it to chase shadows in the dark.
264965,Isn't that what you're doing?,
264966,,I'm doing what I must. Hunting down every last nerubian. Following their trail back to Xal'atath. And claiming vengeance for our dead.
264968,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--",
264969,,"Remain in Dornogal, Anduin. Leave the shadows to me."
266845,I feel the earthen have come a long way since last we were here in the Archive.,
266846,,"A factual statement. When I first answered your queries, the Archive was lost to us. As were the Stonevault and Awakening Machine."
266847,,"But now we have a future. And slowly we will also have our past. Largely we have you and your ""clan"" to thank for it."
266848,"Ye needn't mention it, High Speaker. I'm just glad ye'll be around for... as long as ye were meant to be.",
266849,,Thank you. I will admit that I approach that prospect with some trepidation.
266850,,"The earthen that are emerging from the Stonevault will take our culture to the ends of Azeroth, but..."
266851,,Who knows what lurks here in our past? What will we uncover about our purpose and the titans?
266852,"I hadna thought o' that. Well, come what may, I'll be here to help ye.",
266856,,"Your continued assistance is appreciated. I feel... you have made me feel as though I am part of your ""clan."""
266857,To properly be part o' my clan ye'd have to marry my Gran'da or the like. But that would nae work for many reasons.,
266858,,looks puzzled.
266859,"That was a joke, Brinthe. Ye'll always be part o' my clan--blood, water, or stone.",
267279,,Our group was attacked within a delve by a monster named Zekvir.
267280,,He is the Hand of the Harbinger... Xal'atath.
267281,,There's something within the delves that she doesn't want people to find.
268099,"Ha! I have you cornered now, you pilfering little weave-trash!",
268100,,"Gracious. The little fly thinks he's a proper spider, but he cannot even tell when he's caught in a web."
268104,By the-- who do you think you are? I'll have you know I am one of Ansurek's most prized--,
268105,,You seem to be laboring under the assumption that I care a wit for who you claim to be. I do not. But I WILL tell you who I am. And I will tell you what you are.
268108,,"I am the Widow Arak'nai, the stewardess of Queen Neferess' legacy and the one who weaves the threads of a free Azj-Kahet. And you, Meesk, are nothing more than a trifling supper."
268109,,"Come now, my little ones. It is dinner time."
268111,No... Stay back...! AHHHH!,
268113,,"How pitiful. Come, my little morsel. Let us return to more pleasant webs. You've done well."
268209,<Angry hissing>,
268353,Take a step back. This here is a trap.,
268360,Brann Bronzebeard and the Explorers' League! Cease your explorations.,
268361,"Otherwise you shall face Zekvir, Hand of the Harbinger. We are watching. We are waiting.",
268362,"Ye better believe we won't be stopping! I'll continue exploring tae see if I can find out who exactly this ""Zekvir"" is.",
268948,,<amused chuckle>
